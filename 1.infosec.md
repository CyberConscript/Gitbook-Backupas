# 1.InfoSec

## INFORMATION SECURITY

Information security (or infosec) refers to the protection of data resources from unauthorized access, attack, theft, or damage. Data may be vulnerable because of the way it is stored, the way it is transferred, or the way it is processed. The systems used to store, transmit, and process data must demonstrate the properties of security. Secure information has three properties, often referred to as the CIA Triad:

* Confidentiality means that certain information should only be known to certain people.
* Integrity means that the data is stored and transferred as intended and that modification is only done by authorized sources.
* Availability means that information is accessible to those authorized to view or modify it.

Some security models and researchers identify other properties that secure systems should exhibit. The most important of these is non-repudiation. Non-repudiation means that a subject cannot deny doing something, such as creating, modifying, or sending a resource. For example, a legal document, such as a will, must usually be witnessed when it is signed. If there is a dispute about whether the document was correctly executed, the witness can provide evidence that it was.

## CYBERSECURITY FRAMEWORK

Within the goal of ensuring information security, cybersecurity refers specifically to provisioning secure processing hardware and software. Information security and cybersecurity tasks can be classified as five functions, following the framework developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) ([nist.gov/cyberframework/online-learning/five-functions](https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework/online-learning/five-functions)):

* Identify—develop security policies and capabilities. Evaluate risks, threats, and vulnerabilities and recommend security controls to mitigate them.
* Protect—procure/develop, install, operate, and decommission IT hardware and software assets with security as an embedded requirement of every stage of this operations life cycle.
* Detect—perform ongoing, proactive monitoring to ensure that controls are effective and capable of protecting against new types of threats.
* Respond—identify, analyze, contain, and eradicate threats to systems and data security.
* Recover—implement cybersecurity resilience to restore systems and data if other controls are unable to prevent attacks.

## INFORMATION SECURITY COMPETENCIES

IT professionals working in a role with security responsibilities must be competent in a wide range of disciplines, from network and application design to procurement and human resources (HR). The following activities might be typical of such a role:

* Participate in risk assessments and testing of security systems and make recommendations.
* Specify, source, install, and configure secure devices and software.
* Set up and maintain document access control and user privilege profiles.
* Monitor audit logs, review user privileges, and document access controls.
* Manage security-related incident response and reporting.
* Create and test business continuity and disaster recovery plans and procedures.
* Participate in security training and education programs.

## INFORMATION SECURITY ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

A security policy is a formalized statement that defines how security will be implemented within an organization. It describes the means the organization will take to protect the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of sensitive data and resources. It often consists of multiple individual policies. The implementation of a security policy to support the goals of the CIA triad might be very different for a school, a multinational accountancy firm, or a machine tool manufacturer. However, each of these organizations, or any other organization (in any sector of the economy, whether profit-making or non-profit-making) should have the same interest in ensuring that its employees, equipment, and data are secure against attack or damage.

As part of the process of adopting an effective organizational security posture, employees must be aware of their responsibilities. The structure of security responsibilities will depend on the size and hierarchy of an organization, but these roles are typical.

* Overall internal responsibility for security might be allocated to a dedicated department, run by a Director of Security, Chief Security Officer (CSO), or Chief Information Security Officer (CISO). Historically, responsibility for security might have been allocated to an existing business unit, such as Information and Communications Technology (ICT) or accounting.

However, the goals of a network manager are not always well-aligned with the goals of security; network management focuses on availability over confidentiality. Consequently, security is increasingly thought of as a dedicated function or business unit with its own management structure.

* Managers may have responsibility for a domain, such as building control, ICT, or accounting.
* Technical and specialist staff have responsibility for implementing, maintaining, and monitoring the policy. Security might be made a core competency of systems and network administrators, or there may be dedicated security administrators. One such job title is Information Systems Security Officer (ISSO).
* Non-technical staff have the responsibility of complying with policy and with any relevant legislation.
* External responsibility for security (due care or liability) lies mainly with directors or owners, though again it is important to note that all employees share some measure of responsibility.

NIST's National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education (NICE) categorizes job tasks and job roles within the cybersecurity industry ([gov/itl/applied-cybersecurity/nice/nice-framework-resource-center](https://www.nist.gov/itl/applied-cybersecurity/nice/nice-framework-resource-center)).

The following units are often used to represent the security function within the organizational hierarchy.

## Security Operations Center (SOC) <a href="#id-032a5fd7-0c7e-40e1-84fc-4c78fa91a35b" id="id-032a5fd7-0c7e-40e1-84fc-4c78fa91a35b"></a>

A security operations center (SOC) is a location where security professionals monitor and protect critical information assets across other business functions, such as finance, operations, sales/marketing, and so on. Because SOCs can be difficult to establish, maintain, and finance, they are usually employed by larger corporations, like a government agency or a healthcare company.

## DevSecOps <a href="#id-7a50796f-75c4-44d9-a423-23d6b5980e4c" id="id-7a50796f-75c4-44d9-a423-23d6b5980e4c"></a>

Network operations and use of cloud computing make ever-increasing use of automation through software code. Traditionally, software code would be the responsibility of a programming or development team. Separate development and operations departments or teams can lead to silos, where each team does not work effectively with the other.

Development and operations (DevOps) is a cultural shift within an organization to encourage much more collaboration between developers and system administrators. By creating a highly orchestrated environment, IT personnel and developers can build, test, and release software faster and more reliably. Many consider a DevOps approach to administration as the only way organizations can take full advantage of the potential benefits offered by cloud service providers.

DevSecOps extends the boundary to security specialists and personnel, reflecting the principle that security is a primary consideration at every stage of software development and deployment. This is also known as shift left, meaning that security considerations need to be made during requirements and planning phases, not grafted on at the end. The principle of DevSecOps recognizes this and shows that security expertise must be embedded into any development project. Ancillary to this is the recognition that security operations can be conceived of as software development projects. Security tools can be automated through code. Consequently, security operations need to take on developer expertise to improve detection and monitoring.

## Incident Response <a href="#a3ca70e6-2820-4856-a5e7-81138bf25e0f" id="a3ca70e6-2820-4856-a5e7-81138bf25e0f"></a>

A dedicated cyber incident response team (CIRT)/computer security incident response team (CSIRT)/computer emergency response team (CERT) as a single point-of-contact for the notification of security incidents. This function might be handled by the SOC, or it might be established as an independent business unit.

## SECURITY CONTROL CATEGORIES

Information and cybersecurity assurance is usually considered to take place within an overall process of business risk management. Implementation of cybersecurity functions is often the responsibility of the IT department. There are many different ways of thinking about how IT services should be governed to fulfill overall business needs. Some organizations have developed IT service frameworks to provide best practice guides to implementing IT and cybersecurity. These frameworks can shape company policies and provide checklists of procedures, activities, and technologies that should ideally be in place. Collectively, these procedures, activities, and tools can be referred to as security controls.

A security control is something designed to give a system or data asset the properties of confidentiality, integrity, availability, and non-repudiation. Controls can be divided into three broad categories, representing the way the control is implemented:

* Technical—the control is implemented as a system (hardware, software, or firmware). For example, firewalls, antivirus software, and OS access control models are technical controls. Technical controls may also be described as logical controls.
* Operational—the control is implemented primarily by people rather than systems. For example, security guards and training programs are operational controls rather than technical controls.
*   Managerial—the control gives oversight of the information system. Examples could include risk identification or a tool allowing the evaluation and selection of other security controls.\
    \\

    **Technical Security Controls**

    A technical control is one that uses technology to reduce vulnerabilities. An administrator installs and configures a technical control, and the technical control then provides the protection automatically. Throughout this book, you’ll come across several examples of technical controls. The following list provides a few examples.

    * **Encryption**. Encryption is a strong technical control used to protect the confidentiality of data. This includes data transferred over a network, and data stored on devices such as servers, desktop computers, and mobile devices.
    * **Antivirus software**. Once installed, the antivirus software provides protection against malware infection.
    * **Intrusion detection systems (IDSs)**. An IDS can monitor a network or host for intrusions and provide ongoing protection against various threats.
    * **Firewalls**. Network firewalls restrict network traffic going in and out of a network.
    * **Least Privilege**. The principle of least privilege specifies that individuals or processes are granted only the privileges they need to perform their assigned tasks or functions, but no more. Privileges are a combination of rights and permissions.

    The CompTIA Security+ exam focuses on many physical security and environmental controls. However, it’s important to realize that many of these are also technical controls. For example, a security system that can detect motion and raise an alarm without user intervention is a technical control designed to increase physical security. Similarly, fire suppression systems use technologies to detect fires, raise alarms, and take various other actions to contain or extinguish the fires, all without user intervention. Fire suppression systems are environmental technical controls.

    **Management Security Controls**

    Management controls use planning and assessment methods to reduce and manage risk. Many provide an ongoing review of an organization’s risk management capabilities. Some documents refer to management controls as administrative controls. Some common management controls are:

    * **Risk assessments**. These help quantify and qualify risks within an organization so that the organization can focus on the serious risks. For example, a quantitative risk assessment uses cost and asset values to quantify risks based on monetary values. A qualitative risk assessment uses judgments to categorize risks based on probability and impact.
    * **Vulnerability assessments**. A vulnerability assessment attempts to discover current vulnerabilities or weaknesses. When necessary, an organization implements additional controls to reduce the risk from these vulnerabilities.
    * **Penetration tests**. These go a step further than a vulnerability assessment by attempting to exploit vulnerabilities. For example, a vulnerability assessment might discover a server isn’t kept up-to-date with current patches making it vulnerable to some attacks. A penetration test would attempt to compromise the server by exploiting one or more of the unpatched vulnerabilities.

    Some management controls focus on physical security and the environment. For example, an access list identifies individuals allowed into a secured area. Guards verify individuals are on the access list before allowing them in.

    **Operational Security Controls**

    Operational controls help ensure that day-to-day operations of an organization comply with their overall security plan. People (not technology) implement these controls. Operational controls include the following families:

    * **Awareness and training**. The importance of training to reduce risks cannot be overstated. Training helps users maintain password security, follow a clean desk policy, understand threats such as phishing and malware, and much more.
    * **Configuration and change management**. Configuration management often uses baselines to ensure that systems start in a secure, hardened state. Change management helps ensure that changes don’t result in unintended configuration errors.
    * **Contingency planning**. Business continuity includes several different methods that help an organization plan and prepare for potential system outages. The goal is to reduce the overall impact on the organization if an outage occurs.
    * **Media protection**. Media includes physical media such as USB flash drives, external and internal drives, and backup tapes.
    * **Physical and environmental protection**. This includes physical controls such as cameras, door locks, and environmental controls such as heating and ventilation systems.

\
lthough it uses a more complex scheme, it is worth being aware of the most current way the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) classifies security controls at the time of writing ([nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-53r4.pdf](https://wmx-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com/courses/5731/supplementary/NIST.SP.800-53r4.pdf)

## SECURITY CONTROL FUNCTIONAL TYPES

Security controls can also be classified in types according to the goal or function they perform:

* Preventive—the control acts to eliminate or reduce the likelihood that an attack can succeed. A preventative control operates before an attack can take place. Access control lists (ACL) configured on firewalls and file system objects are preventative-type controls. Anti-malware software also acts as a preventative control, by blocking processes identified as malicious from executing. Directives and standard operating procedures (SOPs) can be thought of as administrative versions of preventative controls.
* Detective—the control may not prevent or deter access, but it will identify and record any attempted or successful intrusion. A detective control operates during the progress of an attack. Logs provide one of the best examples of detective-type controls.
* Corrective—the control acts to eliminate or reduce the impact of an intrusion event. A corrective control is used after an attack. A good example is a backup system that can restore data that was damaged during an intrusion. Another example is a patch management system that acts to eliminate the vulnerability exploited during the attack.

While most controls can be classed functionally as preventative, detective, or corrective, a few other types can be used to define other cases:

* Physical—controls such as alarms, gateways, locks, lighting, security cameras, and guards that deter and detect access to premises and hardware are often classed separately.
* Deterrent—the control may not physically or logically prevent access, but psychologically discourages an attacker from attempting an intrusion. This could include signs and warnings of legal penalties against trespass or intrusion.
* Compensating—the control serves as a substitute for a principal control, as recommended by a security standard, and affords the same (or better) level of protection but uses a different methodology or technology.

##

## NIST CYBERSECURITY FRAMEWORK

A **cybersecurity framework (CSF)** is a list of activities and objectives undertaken to mitigate risks. The use of a framework allows an organization to make an objective statement of its current cybersecurity capabilities, identify a target level of capability, and prioritize investments to achieve that target. This is valuable for giving a structure to internal risk management procedures and provides an externally verifiable statement of regulatory compliance. Frameworks are also important because they save an organization from building its security program in a vacuum, or from building the program on a foundation that fails to account for important security concepts.

There are many different frameworks, each of which categorize cybersecurity activities and controls in slightly different ways. These frameworks are non-regulatory in the sense that they do not attempt to address the specific regulations of a specific industry but represent "best practice" in IT security governance generally. Most organizations will have historically chosen a particular framework; some may use multiple frameworks in conjunction.

Most frameworks are developed for an international audience; others are focused on a domestic national audience. Most of the frameworks are associated with certification programs to show that staff and consultants can apply the methodologies successfully.

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) is a relatively new addition to the IT governance space and distinct from other frameworks by focusing exclusively on IT security, rather than IT service provisioning more generally ([nist.gov/cyberframework](https://nist.gov/cyberframework)). It is developed for a US audience and focuses somewhat on US government, but its recommendations can be adapted for other countries and types of organizations.

NIST's Risk Management Framework (RMF) pre-dates the CSF. Where the CSF focuses on practical cybersecurity for businesses, the RMF is more prescriptive and principally intended for use by federal agencies ([csrc.nist.gov/projects/risk-management/rmf-overview](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/risk-management/rmf-overview)).

As well as its cybersecurity and risk frameworks, NIST is responsible for issuing the Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) plus advisory guides called Special Publications ([csrc.nist.gov/publications/sp](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/sp)). Many of the standards and technologies covered in CompTIA Security+ are discussed in these documents.

## OS AND CLOUD FRAMEWORKS

#### International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 27K <a href="#af353487-44fb-4e37-94c8-b43b02e56708" id="af353487-44fb-4e37-94c8-b43b02e56708"></a>

The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) has produced a cybersecurity framework in conjunction with the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC). The framework was established in 2005 and revised in 2013. Unlike the NIST framework, the ISO 27001 Information Security Management standard must be purchased ([iso.org/standard/54534.html](https://iso.org/standard/54534.html)). ISO 27001 is part of an overall 27000 series of information security standards, also known as 27K. Of these, 27002 classifies security controls, 27017 and 27018 reference cloud security, and 27701 focuses on personal data and privacy.

#### ISO 31K <a href="#d2c0aff4-1f5e-45a2-8c0d-0043664c920b" id="d2c0aff4-1f5e-45a2-8c0d-0043664c920b"></a>

Where ISO 27K is a cybersecurity framework, ISO 31K ([iso.org/iso-31000-risk-management.html](https://www.iso.org/iso-31000-risk-management.html)) is an overall framework for enterprise risk management (ERM). ERM considers risks and opportunities beyond cybersecurity by including financial, customer service, competition, and legal liability factors. ISO 31K establishes best practices for performing risk assessments.

#### Cloud Security Alliance <a href="#id-875b5f4d-6c5c-4f6b-af7e-6076d6a56b6f" id="id-875b5f4d-6c5c-4f6b-af7e-6076d6a56b6f"></a>

The not-for-profit organization Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) produces various resources to assist cloud service providers (CSP) in setting up and delivering secure cloud platforms. These resources can also be useful for cloud consumers in evaluating and selecting cloud services.

* Security Guidance ([cloudsecurityalliance.org/research/guidance](https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/research/guidance))—a best practice summary analyzing the unique challenges of cloud environments and how on-premises controls can be adapted to them.
* Enterprise reference architecture ([ea.cloudsecurityalliance.org](https://ea.cloudsecurityalliance.org/))—best practice methodology and tools for CSPs to use in architecting cloud solutions. The solutions are divided across a number of domains, such as risk management and infrastructure, application, and presentation services.
* Cloud controls matrix ([cloudsecurityalliance.org/research/working-groups/cloud-controls-matrix](https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/research/working-groups/cloud-controls-matrix/))—lists specific controls and assessment guidelines that should be implemented by CSPs. For cloud consumers, the matrix acts as a starting point for cloud contracts and agreements as it provides a baseline level of security competency that the CSP should meet.

#### Statements on Standards for Attestation Engagements (SSAE) Service Organization Control (SOC) <a href="#id-395c684c-e360-44c7-8830-17be01c9ce75" id="id-395c684c-e360-44c7-8830-17be01c9ce75"></a>

The Statements on Standards for Attestation Engagements (SSAE) are audit specifications developed by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA). These audits are designed to assure consumers that service providers—notably cloud providers, but including any type of hosted or third-party service—meet professional standards ([aicpa.org/interestareas/frc/assuranceadvisoryservices/serviceorganization-smanagement.html](https://www.aicpa.org/interestareas/frc/assuranceadvisoryservices/serviceorganization-smanagement.html)). Within SSAE No. 18 (the current specification), there are several levels of reporting:

* Service Organization Control (SOC2)—evaluates the internal controls implemented by the service provider to ensure compliance with Trust Services Criteria (TSC) when storing and processing customer data. TSC refers to security, confidentiality, integrity, availability, and privacy properties. An SOC2 Type I report assesses the system design, while a Type II report assesses the ongoing effectiveness of the security architecture over a period of 6-12 months. SOC2 reports are highly detailed and designed to be restricted. They should only be shared with the auditor and regulators, and with important partners under non-disclosure agreement (NDA) terms.
* SOC3—a less detailed report certifying compliance with SOC2. SOC3 reports can be freely distributed.

## BENCHMARKS AND SECURE CONFIGURATION GUIDES

Although a framework gives a "high-level" view of how to plan IT services, it does not generally provide detailed implementation guidance. At a system level, the deployment of servers and applications is covered by benchmarks and secure configuration guides.

#### Center for Internet Security (CIS) <a href="#id-7a6184a7-7fb5-4e92-bbec-2945e5d74bcc" id="id-7a6184a7-7fb5-4e92-bbec-2945e5d74bcc"></a>

The Center for Internet Security ([cisecurity.org](https://cisecurity.org/)) is a not-for-profit organization (founded partly by The SANS Institute). It publishes the well-known "The CIS Critical Security Controls." The CIS-RAM (Risk Assessment Method) can be used to perform an overall evaluation of security posture ([learn.cisecurity.org/cis-ram](https://learn.cisecurity.org/cis-ram)).

CIS also produces benchmarks for different aspects of cybersecurity. For example, there are benchmarks for compliance with IT frameworks and compliance programs, such as PCI DSS, NIST 800-53, SOX, and ISO 27000. There are also product-focused benchmarks, such as for Windows Desktop, Windows Server, macOS, Linux, Cisco, web browsers, web servers, database and email servers, and VMware ESXi. The CIS-CAT (Configuration Access Tool) can be used with automated vulnerability scanners to test compliance against these benchmarks ([cisecurity.org/cybersecurity-tools/cis-cat-pro/cis-cat-faq](https://www.cisecurity.org/cybersecurity-tools/cis-cat-pro/cis-cat-faq/)).

#### OS/Network Appliance Platform/Vendor-specific Guides <a href="#id-86691549-8cd7-4783-9a12-91b19fdfa983" id="id-86691549-8cd7-4783-9a12-91b19fdfa983"></a>

Operating system (OS) best practice configuration lists the settings and controls that should be applied for a computing platform to work in a defined role, such as client workstation, authentication server, network switch/router/firewall, web/application server, and so on.

Most vendors will provide guides, templates, and tools for configuring and validating the deployment of network appliances, operating systems, web servers, and application/database servers. The security configurations for each of these devices will vary not only by vendor but by device and version as well. The vendor's support portal will host the configuration guides (along with setup/install guides and software downloads and updates) or they can be easily located using a web search engine.

There is also detailed guidance available from several organizations to cover both vendor-neutral deployments and to provide third-party assessment and advice on deploying vendor products. Apart from the CIS controls, some notable sources include:

* Department of Defense Cyber Exchange provides Security Technical Implementation Guides (STIGs) with hardening guidelines for a variety of software and hardware solutions ([public.cyber.mil](https://public.cyber.mil/)).
* National Checklist Program (NCP) by NIST provides checklists and benchmarks for a variety of operating systems and applications ([nvd.nist.gov/ncp/repository](https://nvd.nist.gov/ncp/repository)).

#### Application Servers <a href="#e1f13bd0-6997-48a6-b6c7-caf48f34bf4e" id="e1f13bd0-6997-48a6-b6c7-caf48f34bf4e"></a>

Most application architectures use a client/server model. This means that part of the application is a client software program, installed and run on separate hardware to the server application code. The client interacts with the server over a network. Attacks can therefore be directed at the local client code, at the server application, or at the network channel between them. As well as coding issues, the applications need to take account of platform issues. The client application might be running in a computing host alongside other, potentially malicious, software. Code that runs on the client should not be trusted. The server-side code should implement routines to verify that input conforms to what is expected.

#### Web Server Applications <a href="#id-1dabaca3-c0fc-4e04-bc32-5e40e740cfef" id="id-1dabaca3-c0fc-4e04-bc32-5e40e740cfef"></a>

A web application is a particular type of client/server architecture. A web application leverages existing technologies to simplify development. The application uses a generic client (a web browser), and standard network protocols and servers (HTTP/HTTPS). The specific features of the application are developed using code running on the clients and servers. Web applications are also likely to use a multi-tier architecture, where the server part is split between application logic and data storage and retrieval. Modern web applications may use even more distributed architectures, such as microservices and serverless.

The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) is a not-for-profit, online community that publishes several secure application development resources, such as the Top 10 list of the most critical application security risks ([owasp.org/www-project-top-ten](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/)). OWASP has also developed resources, such as the Zed Attack Proxy and Juice Shop (a deliberately unsecure web application), to help investigate and understand penetration testing and application security issues.

## REGULATIONS, STANDARDS, AND LEGISLATION

The key frameworks, benchmarks, and configuration guides may be used to demonstrate compliance with a country's legal/regulatory requirements or with industry-specific regulations. _Due diligence_ is a legal term meaning that responsible persons have not been negligent in discharging their duties. Negligence may create criminal and civil liabilities. Many countries have enacted legislation that criminalizes negligence in information management. In the US, for example, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) mandates the implementation of risk assessments, internal controls, and audit procedures. The Computer Security Act (1987) requires federal agencies to develop security policies for computer systems that process confidential information. In 2002, the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) was introduced to govern the security of data processed by federal government agencies.

#### Personal Data and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) <a href="#a5cae894-40ad-4509-95ba-ba260bef0d30" id="a5cae894-40ad-4509-95ba-ba260bef0d30"></a>

Where some types of legislation address cybersecurity due diligence, others focus in whole or in part on information security as it affects privacy or personal data. Privacy is a distinct concept from security. Privacy requires that collection and processing of personal information be both secure and fair. Fairness and the right to privacy, as enacted by regulations such as the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), means that personal data cannot be collected, processed, or retained without the individual's informed consent. _Informed consent_ means that the data must be collected and processed only for the stated purpose, and that purpose must be clearly described to the user in plain language, not legalese. GDPR ([ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/)) gives data subjects rights to withdraw consent, and to inspect, amend, or erase data held about them.

#### National, Territory, or State Laws <a href="#id-2c80cc8e-e016-4e87-83d2-14d62bcc651d" id="id-2c80cc8e-e016-4e87-83d2-14d62bcc651d"></a>

Compliance issues are complicated by the fact that laws derive from different sources. For example, the GDPR does not apply to American data subjects, but it does apply to American companies that collect or process the personal data of people in EU countries. In the US, there are national federal laws, state laws, plus a body of law applying to US territories (Puerto Rico, the US Virgin Islands, Guam, and American Samoa). Federal laws tend to focus either on regulations like FISMA for federal departments or as "vertical" laws affecting a particular industry. Examples of the latter include the Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act (GLBA) for financial services, and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).

Some states have started to introduce "horizontal" personal data regulations, similar to the approach taken by the GDPR. One high-profile example of state legislation is the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) ([csoonline.com/article/3292578/california-consumer-privacy-act-what-you-need-to-know-to-be-compliant.html](https://www.csoonline.com/article/3292578/california-consumer-privacy-act-what-you-need-to-know-to-be-compliant.html)).

#### Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) <a href="#bddc56fd-4bf6-4059-bf59-376c4c877b96" id="bddc56fd-4bf6-4059-bf59-376c4c877b96"></a>

Compliance issues can also arise from industry-mandated regulations. For example, the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) defines the safe handling and storage of financial information ([pcisecuritystandards.org/pci\_security](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/pci_security/)).

Varonis' blog contains a useful overview of privacy laws in the US ([varonis.com/blog/us-privacy-laws](https://www.varonis.com/blog/us-privacy-laws/)).\\
