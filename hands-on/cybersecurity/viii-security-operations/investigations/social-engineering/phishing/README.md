# Phishing

## **Phishing**

Concept of fishing for information. Phishing is employed by attackers to obtain sensitive, confidential, or private information. Phishing can be done using any communication means, including face-to-face interactions and over the phone. Organizations should consider the consequences and increased risk that granting workers access to personal email and social networks through company systems poses.

## Smishing

Smishing SMS phishing or smishing is a social engineering attack that occurs over or through standard text messaging services or apps. There are several smishing threats to watch out for, including the following:

* Text messages asking for a response or reply. In some cases, replies could trigger a cramming event. (Cramming is when a false or unauthorized charge is placed onto your mobile service plan)
* Text messages could include a malicious hyperlink
* Text messages could include phone numbers that if called result in excessive toll charges.

## **SPIM**

_SPIM_ (spam over instant messaging) is instant messaging spam, and much like the more common e-mail spam, it occurs when a user receives an unsolicited instant message from another user, including users who are known and in the userâ€™s contact list. Instant messaging services provide a lot of information about users, including demographic, gender, and age information, that can be used for targeted spam advertising. These messages can contain ads or links to viruses, malware, and phishing sites.

Users can protect themselves from SPIM and other IM-related security issues by making sure that only people on their contact list can send them messages. In many cases, organizations have completely blocked access to external IM chat services.

## Vishing&#x20;

Vishing is phishing done over any telephony or voice communication system. This includes traditional phone lines, Voice-over-IP (VoIP) services, and mobile phones. \
VOIP allows the attacker to be located anywhere in the world, make free phone calls to victims, and be able to falsify or spoof their origin caller ID.&#x20;

## Spam&#x20;

\
Spam is any type of email that is undesired and/or unsolicited. Spam is a problem for numerous reasons:&#x20;

* Spam might carry malicious code such as virus, logic bom, ransomware, or Trojan horses.&#x20;
* Spam can carry other social engineering attacks.
* Unwanted email wastes your time while you sort through it looking for legitimate messages&#x20;
* Spam wastes Internet resources: storage capacity, computing cycles, and throughput.
* Spoofed email. When an email server receives an email message, it should perform a reverse lookup on the source address of the message.&#x20;

Spam is most commonly associated with email, but spam also exists in instant messaging (IM), Short Message Service (SMS), USENET (network news transfer protocol (NNTP), and web content.

## Spear phishing&#x20;

**Spear phishing** is a more targeted form of phishing where the message is crafted and directed specifically to a group of individuals. False messages are crafted to seem like a communication from the other business. Someone who already has an online/ digital relationship with an spoofed organization is more likely to fall for the false communication.&#x20;
