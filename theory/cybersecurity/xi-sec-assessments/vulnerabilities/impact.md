**Impact of Vulnerabilities**

Vulnerabilities can result in various scenarios of data breach and data loss, leading to significant consequences in terms of costs and harm to the organization's image.

**Impacts of Data Breaches and Data Exfiltration**

Data should only be collected, stored, and processed by authorized users and hosts according to the permissions granted by the data owner. Data breaches and data exfiltration involve unauthorized use of information:

1. **Data Breach Event:** Unauthorized reading, transferring, modification, or deletion of confidential data. It can be intentional or accidental, also known as a data leak.
2. **Privacy Breach:** Mishandling of personal data, violating regulations. Breaches can be intentional or accidental.
3. **Data Exfiltration:** Intentional, malicious transfer of data from victim's systems to external networks. A consequence of data breach.

Data breaches encompass various scenarios with varying impact levels. Severe breaches compromise intellectual property or personal data of account holders.

**Impacts of Identity Theft**

A privacy breach might enable identity theft or selling data to malicious actors. Attackers can obtain credentials or use personal and financial details for fraudulent activities.

**Impacts of Data Loss and Availability**

Data loss makes information permanently or temporarily unavailable. Availability, often overlooked, can severely affect business workflows. System downtime due to disasters can disrupt crucial processes like order fulfillment.

**Financial and Reputation Consequences**

These impacts lead to financial losses through damages, fines, and decreased business. Data breaches and availability losses also tarnish a company's reputation, affecting direct customers. Major events can trigger negative publicity on social and mainstream media. Incident handling teams should include PR and marketing experts to mitigate reputation damage.
