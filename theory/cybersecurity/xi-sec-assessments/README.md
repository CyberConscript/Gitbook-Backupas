# XI) Sec Assessments

Network reconnaissance and discovery play a crucial role in identifying hosts, network topology, and accessible services/ports, thereby defining the overall attack surface. To assess the vulnerabilities of these hosts and services, various types of security assessments come into play. A plethora of models and frameworks guide these security evaluations, with NIST's Technical Guide to Information Security Testing and Assessment (nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-115.pdf) serving as a valuable starting point. SP 800-115 outlines three primary activities within an assessment:

1. Testing the assessment subject to uncover vulnerabilities or validate the efficacy of security controls.
2. Scrutinizing assessment subjects to comprehend the security system and reveal any logical weaknesses. This might expose deficiencies in security controls or common misconfigurations.
3. Conducting interviews with personnel to amass information and delve into their attitudes and comprehension of security matters.

Commonly categorized security assessment types include vulnerability assessment, threat hunting, and penetration testing. A vulnerability assessment involves evaluating a system's security and its capacity to meet compliance mandates based on its current configuration state. Essentially, it compares the present configuration with the ideal configuration (the baseline). Vulnerability assessments can encompass manual inspection of security controls, but automated vulnerability scanners are more frequently employed for this purpose.
