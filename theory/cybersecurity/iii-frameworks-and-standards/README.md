# III) Frameworks and standards

Cybersecurity Framework

A **cybersecurity framework (CSF)** is a list of activities and objectives undertaken to mitigate cyber security risks. Framework when used allows an organization to make an objective statement of its current cybersecurity capabilities, identify a target level of capability, and prioritize investments to achieve that target.&#x20;

Numerous frameworks exist, each slightly varying in how they categorize cybersecurity actions and controls. These frameworks are not regulatory in nature; they don't address specific industry regulations but rather represent the prevailing best practices in IT security governance at large. Most organizations historically select a particular framework, and some might even combine multiple frameworks. The majority of these frameworks possess an international scope, although some target national audiences. Many of them are tied to certification programs to showcase successful implementation by staff and consultants.
