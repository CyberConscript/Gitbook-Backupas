## **Implementation Groups**

The Center for Internet Security (CIS) provides a categorization of the 20 Critical Security Controls into three Implementation Groups (IGs) based on their prioritization and level of difficulty to implement. These groups help organizations approach the implementation of the controls in a phased and manageable manner. Here's an explanation of CIS Implementation Groups 1, 2, and 3:

**Implementation Group 1 (IG1):** IG1 focuses on the most essential security controls that organizations should implement as a foundational step to improve their cybersecurity posture. These controls provide a strong starting point for building a solid security foundation. IG1 includes a subset of critical controls from the larger list, specifically tailored to address the highest-priority security risks.

**Implementation Group 2 (IG2):** IG2 builds upon the controls in IG1 by adding more controls that expand an organization's security capabilities. These controls are still considered fundamental and provide additional layers of defense against a broader range of threats. Organizations that have successfully implemented controls from IG1 can progress to IG2 to enhance their cybersecurity resilience.

**Implementation Group 3 (IG3):** IG3 represents the highest level of cybersecurity maturity and includes the full set of 20 Critical Security Controls. Organizations that have effectively implemented controls from IG1 and IG2 can further advance their security posture by implementing the remaining controls in IG3. These controls address more advanced security measures and strategic initiatives to achieve comprehensive protection.

In summary, the CIS Implementation Groups provide a phased approach to implementing the 20 Critical Security Controls. Organizations can start with IG1, focusing on foundational controls, and then progress to IG2 and IG3 as they enhance their cybersecurity capabilities. The groups help organizations tailor their security efforts to their current maturity level and gradually build a robust and effective cybersecurity program.
