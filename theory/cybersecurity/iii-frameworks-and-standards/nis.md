# NIS

NIS 2 is an update of the NIS Directive. It came into act in July 2023 and EU member states are required to add it to their legislation by October 2024. NIS 2 aims to expand NIS, adding new cybersecurity requirements and new sectors that are required to comply This is meant to enhance the resilience and incident response of the EU and its public and private entities.



To audit compliance with the NIS2 Directive, you should check for the following key requirements:

1. **Governance**:
   * Evidence of robust leadership involvement in cybersecurity.
   * Defined roles and responsibilities for managing cybersecurity risks.
   * Ongoing risk assessments and a culture of proactive security management.
2. **Security Measures**:
   * Implementation of a Zero Trust security model, including advanced authentication measures like continuous authentication.
   * Protection against supply chain risks, ensuring vendors meet cybersecurity standards.
   * Regular security updates and patches for networks and systems.
3. **Incident Response**:
   * Incident response and recovery plans, including steps for handling and mitigating breaches.
   * Logging and monitoring capabilities for detecting and addressing security incidents.
4. **Employee Training and Awareness**:
   * Programs to educate employees about cybersecurity risks and their roles in preventing breaches.
   * Periodic training to create a "human firewall" against cyber threats.
5. **Documentation**:
   * Comprehensive documentation of security policies, processes, and risk assessments.
   * Up-to-date inventory of critical assets and systems.
6. **Communication and Reporting**:
   * Clear procedures for reporting significant incidents to regulatory authorities.
   * Transparency in reporting supply chain vulnerabilities or incidents.
7. **Supply Chain Security**:

   * Contracts with vendors detailing their obligations regarding security measures.
8. **Compliance with Security Standards**:
   * Alignment with cybersecurity frameworks such as ISO 27001.
   * Regular audits to assess and ensure compliance with NIS2 requirements.
9. **Specific Sectoral Measures**:
   * Ensure entities classified as "essential" or "important" implement additional safeguards as required for their sector.
10. **Fines and Accountability**:

* Awareness of potential penalties for non-compliance, which can reach €10 million or 2% of global turnover for "essential" entities.

**18. Governance and Accountability**

* Are cybersecurity roles (e.g., CISO) defined and staffed appropriately?
* Is senior management involved in cybersecurity decision-making?
* Are KPIs defined to measure the effectiveness of cybersecurity programs?

**19. Supply Chain and Third-Party Risks**

* Are all third-party ICT providers assessed for compliance with cybersecurity standards?
* Is there a procedure to terminate access for non-compliant vendors?

**20. Threat Intelligence and Information Sharing**

* Does the organization participate in threat intelligence sharing communities?
* Are threat feeds integrated into monitoring and detection systems?

**21. Reporting and Regulatory Alignment**

* Are systems in place to meet mandatory reporting timelines for incidents?
* Is there a process to update policies and procedures when regulations change?

These requirements ensure organizations strengthen their cybersecurity posture to address evolving threats while maintaining compliance with the NIS2 Directive. For further details, consult tailored checklists like those provided by compliance platforms or services.



Your questioner is detailed and structured, but with updates to regulations like **NIS2**, it’s important to ensure alignment with the latest requirements.
