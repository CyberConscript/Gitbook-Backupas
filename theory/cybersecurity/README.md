# CyberSecurity

Cybersecurity involves an ongoing cycle of evaluating security needs, establishing protective measures, reinforcing standard systems, and addressing both ongoing and after-the-fact cyber threats. To be successful in this field you should strong familiarization of fundamentals.&#x20;

## Infosec

Information security, also known as infosec, encompasses safeguarding data resources against unauthorized access, malicious attacks, theft, or harm. Data susceptibility can arise due to its storage methods, transfer processes, or handling procedures. Secured information possesses three fundamental properties, commonly denoted as the CIA Triad:

* **Confidentiality** means that certain information should only be known to certain people.&#x20;
* **Integrity** means that the data is stored and transferred as intended and that modification is only done by authorized sources.&#x20;
* **Availability** means that information is accessible to those authorized to view or modify it.&#x20;

**Non-repudiation** ensures the prevention of a party from refuting their involvement in a specific action, such as generating, altering, or transmitting a resource. For instance, legal documents like wills often require witnesses during the signing process. In case a disagreement arises concerning the proper execution of the document, the witness can offer evidence affirming its legitimacy.

## Cybersecurity frameworks

In the pursuit of maintaining the integrity of information, cybersecurity focuses specifically on providing secure hardware and software systems for processing. The tasks related to information security and cybersecurity can be categorized into five distinct functions, as outlined by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST):

1. **Identify**: This involves the development of security policies and capabilities. It encompasses the assessment of risks, threats, and vulnerabilities, leading to the recommendation of appropriate security measures for mitigation.
2. **Protect**: The "Protect" function involves the complete lifecycle management of IT hardware and software assets. This includes their acquisition, development, installation, operation, and eventual decommissioning. Security is intricately woven into every phase of this process.
3. **Detect**: The "Detect" function centers around proactive and continuous monitoring. The goal is to ensure that the security controls in place are effective and capable of defending against emerging threats.
4. **Respond**: In this function, the focus is on the swift and efficient response to threats. This includes identifying, analyzing, containing, and ultimately eradicating threats to the security of systems and data.
5. **Recover**: The "Recover" function emphasizes the establishment of cybersecurity resilience. This is crucial for restoring systems and data in cases where other security measures were unable to prevent an attack.

By adhering to these five functions, organizations can significantly bolster their cybersecurity posture and ensure comprehensive protection of their information assets. This framework provides a structured approach to addressing the multifaceted challenges of cybersecurity. For more in-depth learning, you can explore the NIST Cybersecurity Framework online (nist.gov/cyberframework/online-learning/five-functions).

Acquiring competence in these areas equips professionals to effectively navigate the multifaceted landscape of information security, enabling them to proficiently address challenges and ensure the safeguarding of digital assets.

## Roles and Responsibilities in Information Security

A security policy represents a formal statement outlining the implementation of security practices within an organization. It outlines the strategies an organization will employ to safeguard the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of sensitive data and resources. Often, it consists of various individual policies. The manner in which a security policy is implemented to uphold the CIA triad's objectives may significantly differ among various entities, such as a school, a multinational accounting firm, or a machine tool manufacturer. Regardless, all organizations—across sectors, be it profit or non-profit—share a common interest in securing their employees, equipment, and data from potential threats or harm.

As part of fostering a robust organizational security stance, employees must comprehend their responsibilities. The allocation of security responsibilities hinges on an organization's size and hierarchy. Below are common roles seen in this context:

1. **Security Leadership**:
   * An exclusive department could assume overall internal security responsibility, led by a Director of Security, Chief Security Officer (CSO), or Chief Information Security Officer (CISO).
   * Historically, existing business units like Information and Communications Technology (ICT) or accounting might have managed security. Yet, differing priorities—like availability versus confidentiality—have led to security becoming a distinct, independent function.
2. **Managers**:
   * Managers may be accountable for specific domains, such as building control, ICT, or accounting.
3. **Technical and Specialist Staff**:
   * Technical experts oversee policy implementation, maintenance, and monitoring. This could be managed by dedicated security administrators or systems and network administrators with security as a core skill set. The role of an Information Systems Security Officer (ISSO) falls in this category.
4. **Non-Technical Staff**:
   * Non-technical staff hold the responsibility of adhering to policy and relevant legal requirements.
5. **External Responsibility**:
   * External security responsibility, often known as due care or liability, primarily rests with directors or owners. Nonetheless, it's important to recognize that all employees bear some level of responsibility.

## Information Security Business Units

The following units are often used to represent the security function within the organizational hierarchy.

#### Security Operations Center (SOC) <a href="#id-032a5fd7-0c7e-40e1-84fc-4c78fa91a35b" id="id-032a5fd7-0c7e-40e1-84fc-4c78fa91a35b"></a>

A security operations center (SOC) is a location where security professionals monitor and protect critical information assets across other business functions, such as finance, operations, sales/marketing, and so on. Because SOCs can be difficult to establish, maintain, and finance, they are usually employed by larger corporations, like a government agency or a healthcare company.&#x20;

**DevSecOps**

The rise of network operations and cloud computing has led to an increased reliance on automation through software code. Traditionally, software code was the responsibility of separate development and operations teams. This division could create silos where effective collaboration was lacking.

DevOps, or Development and Operations, is a cultural shift aimed at fostering more collaboration between developers and system administrators. By creating a well-coordinated environment, IT personnel and developers can accelerate the software development, testing, and release process. Many see DevOps as essential for organizations to fully capitalize on the advantages provided by cloud service providers.

DevSecOps expands this concept to include security specialists, reflecting the notion that security should be a core consideration throughout software development and deployment. This is often termed "shift left," signifying that security concerns should be integrated during the early requirements and planning stages, rather than being added as an afterthought. DevSecOps underscores the importance of integrating security expertise into every development project. Additionally, it recognizes that security operations can be treated as software development initiatives, automating security tools through code. Therefore, security operations require developer expertise to enhance detection and monitoring capabilities.

**Incident Response**

A dedicated team for cyber incident response (CIRT), a computer security incident response team (CSIRT), or a computer emergency response team (CERT) can serve as a central point of contact for reporting security incidents. This role could be managed by a Security Operations Center (SOC), or it might function as an independent business unit.



## Security Control Categories

Information and cybersecurity assurance is usually considered to take place within an overall process of business risk management. Implementation of cybersecurity functions is often the responsibility of the IT department. There are many different ways of thinking about how IT services should be governed to fulfill overall business needs. Some organizations have developed IT service frameworks to provide best practice guides to implementing IT and cybersecurity. These frameworks can shape company policies and provide checklists of procedures, activities, and technologies that should ideally be in place. Collectively, these procedures, activities, and tools can be referred to as security controls.

Security controls are measures or safeguards implemented to protect information systems and data from various threats and risks. They can be categorized into several different types based on their purpose and functionality. Here are some common types of security controls:

1. **Administrative Controls**: also known as managerial or organizational controls, are security measures that focus on human behavior and management practices to reduce risks and enhance security. These controls involve policies, procedures, guidelines, and training that guide employees and users in making secure decisions and following best practices. Administrative controls establish the framework within which security is managed across an organization. Examples include security policies, access management procedures, security awareness training programs, risk assessments, incident response plans, and employee background checks.
   * Policies and Procedures: Guidelines that define how security is managed, outlining roles, responsibilities, and processes.
   * Security Awareness Training: Educating employees about security risks and best practices to promote a security-conscious culture.
   * Access Management: Processes for granting, modifying, and revoking user access rights to systems and data.
   * Risk Management: Identifying, assessing, and mitigating risks to information systems and assets.
2. **Technical Controls**: security measures that involve the use of technology and tools to protect systems, data, and networks. These controls are implemented through hardware, software, and configurations to enforce security policies and prevent or detect unauthorized access and malicious activities. Technical controls include authentication mechanisms, encryption, firewalls, intrusion detection systems, antivirus software, access control lists, and security patches. They work at the system and network level to ensure security requirements are met.
   * Authentication: Verifying the identity of users, devices, or processes before granting access.
   * Encryption: Converting data into a secure format to prevent unauthorized access if the data is intercepted.
   * Firewall: A network device that monitors and filters incoming and outgoing network traffic based on defined security rules.
   * Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS): Monitoring network traffic to detect and prevent unauthorized access or attacks.
   * Antivirus and Antimalware: Software designed to detect and remove malicious software from systems.
3. **Physical Controls**: security measures designed to protect physical assets, premises, and facilities. These controls focus on preventing unauthorized physical access to sensitive areas and assets. Physical controls involve measures such as locks, biometric access systems, security guards, surveillance cameras, fences, and alarms. They help safeguard physical resources like servers, data centers, offices, and equipment from theft, vandalism, and unauthorized entry.
   * Access Control Systems: Mechanisms such as biometric scanners or keycards used to control entry to physical facilities.
   * Security Cameras: Surveillance systems that monitor and record activities in physical areas.
   * Secure Facilities: Physical security measures like locks, fences, and secure rooms to protect equipment and data centers.
4. **Audit and Monitoring Controls**:
   * Audit Trails: Records of activities, transactions, or events for later review and analysis.
   * Log Management: Collecting, storing, and analyzing logs from various systems to identify security incidents.
   * Security Information and Event Management (SIEM): Centralized solutions that aggregate and analyze security events from multiple sources.
5. **Configuration Management Controls**:
   * Patch Management: Regularly updating and applying security patches to software and systems.
   * Change Management: Process for controlling and documenting changes to IT systems to prevent unintended security vulnerabilities.
   * Baseline Configuration: Establishing a secure configuration standard for systems and applications.
6. **Application Controls**:
   * Input Validation: Ensuring that data entered into applications is safe and doesn't lead to vulnerabilities like SQL injection.
   * Error Handling and Logging: Properly managing application errors and logging to prevent exposing sensitive information.

These are just a few examples of the types of security controls that organizations can implement to protect their information systems and data. An effective security strategy typically involves a combination of controls from various categories to create a comprehensive defense against threats.

## Security Control Functional Types

These classifications help to understand the specific goals and functions that different security controls serve within an organization's security strategy. Here's a summary of each type:

**1. Preventive Controls:** Preventive controls are designed to eliminate or reduce the likelihood of a security breach or attack. They act as barriers to prevent attackers from gaining unauthorized access. Examples include access control lists on firewalls, antivirus software blocking malicious processes, and security policies that dictate secure practices. These controls aim to stop attacks before they can succeed.

**2. Detective Controls:** Detective controls focus on identifying and recording attempted or successful intrusions. While they may not prevent attacks, they provide mechanisms for detecting and alerting when security incidents occur. Examples include log monitoring, intrusion detection systems, and security cameras. These controls help in quickly identifying and responding to security breaches.

**3. Corrective Controls:** Corrective controls come into play after an attack to minimize its impact. They help restore systems and data to a secure state and address the vulnerabilities exploited. Examples include backup and recovery systems, patch management to fix vulnerabilities, and incident response plans that outline steps to mitigate damage and recover from attacks.

**4. Physical Controls:** Physical controls involve measures that protect physical assets, premises, and facilities. These controls include security cameras, locks, alarms, guards, and other physical barriers. They focus on preventing unauthorized physical access to sensitive areas and resources.

**5. Deterrent Controls:** Deterrent controls aim to psychologically discourage potential attackers from attempting intrusions. They may not physically prevent access, but they create an environment that discourages unauthorized actions. Examples include warning signs indicating legal consequences for trespassing or intrusion.

**6. Compensating Controls:** Compensating controls act as substitutes for principal controls, offering equivalent or better levels of protection using different methodologies or technologies. They are often used when it's not feasible to implement the recommended primary control. These controls ensure security requirements are met through alternative means.

Understanding these functional types helps organizations tailor their security strategy by implementing a combination of controls that collectively address various aspects of security risks and vulnerabilities.
