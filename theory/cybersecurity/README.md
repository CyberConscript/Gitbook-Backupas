Information security, also known as infosec, encompasses safeguarding data resources against unauthorized access, malicious attacks, theft, or harm. Data susceptibility can arise due to its storage methods, transfer processes, or handling procedures. Secured information possesses three fundamental properties, commonly denoted as the CIA Triad:

* **Confidentiality** means that certain information should only be known to certain people.&#x20;
* **Integrity** means that the data is stored and transferred as intended and that modification is only done by authorized sources.&#x20;
* **Availability** means that information is accessible to those authorized to view or modify it.&#x20;

**Non-repudiation** ensures the prevention of a party from refuting their involvement in a specific action, such as generating, altering, or transmitting a resource. For instance, legal documents like wills often require witnesses during the signing process. In case a disagreement arises concerning the proper execution of the document, the witness can offer evidence affirming its legitimacy.
