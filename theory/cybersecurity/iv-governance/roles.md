# Roles

## RACI Charts

\
Many organizations utilize RACI (Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed)\
charts to denote key responsibilities in business processes, projects, tasks, and other\
activities. A RACI chart assigns levels of responsibility to individuals and groups.\
The development of a RACI chart helps personnel determine roles for various business activities. A typical RACI chart follows

The four roles in a RACI chart are defined as follows:\
• **Responsible** The person or group that performs the actual work or task.\
• **Accountable** The person who is ultimately answerable for complete,\
accurate, and timely execution of the work. Often this is a person who\
manages those in the Responsible role.\
• **Consulted** One or more people or groups consulted for their opinions,\
experience, or insight. People in the Consulted role may be a subject-matter\
expert for the work or task, or an owner, steward, or custodian of an asset\
associated with the work or task. Communication with the Consulted role\
is two-way.\
• **Informed** One or more people or groups informed by those in other roles.\
Depending on the process or task, people in the Informed role may be told\
of an activity before, during, or after its completion. Communication with\
the Informed role is one-way.



When assigning roles to individuals and groups in a RACI chart, several aspects\
must be considered, including the following:\
• Skills Some or all individuals in a team assignment, as well as specifically\
named individuals, need to have the skills, training, and competence to\
carry out tasks as required.\
• Segregation of duties Critical tasks, such as the user account provisioning\
RACI chart depicted earlier, must be free of segregation of duties conflicts.\
This means that two or more individuals or groups must be required to carry\
out a critical task. In this example, the requestor, approver, and provisioner\
cannot be the same person or group.\
• Conflict of interest Critical tasks must not be assigned to individuals or\
groups when such assignments will create conflicts of interest. For example,\
a user who is an approver cannot approve a request for their own access.\
In this case, a different person must approve the request while avoiding a\
segregation of duties conflict.



## Board of directors

An organization’s board of directors oversees activities in the organization. Depending on\
the type of organization, board members may be elected by shareholders or constituents,\
or they may be appointed. This role can be either paid or voluntary in nature.

Activities performed by the board of directors, as well as directors’ authority, are\
usually defined by a constitution, bylaws, or external regulation. The board is typically accountable to the organization’s owners or, in the case of a government body,\
to the electorate.\
In many cases, board members have fiduciary duty. This means they are accountable to shareholders or constituents to act in the organization’s best interests with\
no appearance of impropriety, conflict of interest, or ill-gotten profit resulting from\
their actions.

In nongovernment organizations (NGOs), the board of directors is responsible for\
appointing a chief executive officer (CEO) and possibly other executives. The CEO,\
then, is accountable to the board of directors and carries out the board’s directives.\
Board members may also be selected for any of the following reasons:\
• Investor representation One or more board members may be appointed by\
significant investors to give them control over the strategy and direction of the\
organization.\
• Business experience Board members bring outside business management\
experience, which helps them develop successful business strategies for the\
organization.\
• Access to resources Board members bring business connections, including\
additional investors, business partners, suppliers, or customers.



In its publication “Cyber-Risk Oversight 2020,” the National Association of\
Corporate Directors (NACD) has developed five principles regarding the importance\
of information security:\
• Principle 1: Directors need to understand and approach cybersecurity as a strategic,\
enterprise risk—not just as an IT risk.\
• Principle 2: Directors should understand the legal implications of cyber risks as\
they relate to their company’s specific circumstances.\
• Principle 3: Boards should have adequate access to cybersecurity expertise, and\
discussions about cyber-risk management should be given regular and adequate\
time on board meeting agendas.\
• Principle 4: Directors should set the expectation that management will establish\
an enterprise-wide cyber-risk management framework with adequate staffing\
and budget.\
• Principle 5: Board-management discussions about cyber risk should include\
identification and quantification of financial exposure to cyber risks and which\
risks to accept, mitigate, or transfer, such as through insurance, as well as specific\
plans associated with each approach.\

## Executive management

Executive management is responsible for carrying out directives issued by the board of\
directors. Information security management includes ensuring that sufficient organizational resources are devoted to implementing a security program and developing and\
maintaining security controls to protect critical assets.\
Executive management must ensure that priorities are balanced. In the case of IT\
and information security, these functions are usually tightly coupled but sometimes in\
conflict. IT’s primary mission is to develop and operate business-enabling capabilities\
through the use of information systems, while information security’s mission includes\
risk management, security, privacy, and compliance. Executive management must ensure\
that these two sometimes-conflicting missions are successful.\
Typical IT- and security-related executive position titles include the following:\
• **Chief information officer (CIO)** This is the topmost leader in a larger\
IT organization.\
• **Chief technical officer (CTO)** This position is usually responsible for an\
organization’s overall technology strategy. Depending upon the organization’s\
purpose, the CTO may be separate from IT.\
• **Chief information security officer (CISO)** This position is responsible for\
all aspects of data-related security. This usually includes incident management,\
disaster recovery, vulnerability management, and compliance. This role is typically\
separate from IT.

To ensure the success of the organization’s information security program, executive\
management should be involved in three key areas:\
• Ratify corporate security policy Security policies developed by the\
information security function should be visibly ratified or endorsed by\
executive management. This may take different forms, such as formal, minuted\
ratification in a governance meeting; a statement of the need for compliance\
along with a signature within the body of the security policy document; a\
separate memorandum to all personnel; or other visible communication to\
the organization’s rank and file that stresses the importance of, and need for\
compliance to, the organization’s information security policy.\
• Leadership by example With regard to information security policy, executive\
management should lead by example and not exhibit behavior suggesting they are\
“above” security policy—or other policies. Executives should not be seen to enjoy\
special privileges of the nature that suggest that one or more security policies do\
not apply to them. Instead, their behavior should visibly support security policies\
that all personnel are expected to comply with.\
• Ultimate responsibility Executives are ultimately responsible for all actions\
carried out by the personnel who report to them. Executives are also ultimately\
responsible for all outcomes related to organizations to which operations have\
been outsourced.



## Security Steering Committee

Many organizations form a security steering committee consisting of stakeholders\
from many (if not all) of the organization’s business units, departments, functions,\
and principal locations. A steering committee may have a variety of responsibilities,\
including the following:\
• **Risk treatment deliberation and recommendation** The committee may\
discuss relevant risks, discuss potential avenues of risk treatment, and develop\
recommendations for said risk treatment for ratification by executive management.\
• **Discussion and coordination of IT and security projects** Committee\
members may discuss various IT and security projects to resolve resource or\
scheduling conflicts. They may also discuss potential conflicts between multiple\
projects and initiatives and work out solutions.\
• **Review of recent risk assessments** The committee may discuss recent risk\
assessments to develop a common understanding of their results, and they may\
discuss remediation of findings.\
• **Discussion of new laws, regulations, and requirements** The committee may\
discuss new laws, regulations, and requirements that may impose changes in the\
organization’s operations. Committee members can develop high-level strategies\
that their respective business units or departments can further build out.

• **Review of recent security incidents** Steering committee members can\
discuss recent security incidents and their root causes. Often this can result in\
changes in processes, procedures, or technologies to reduce the risk and impact\
of future incidents

Reading between the lines, the primary mission of a security steering committee is to\
identify and resolve conflicts and to maximize the effectiveness of the security program,\
as balanced among other business initiatives and priorities.
