# Roles

## RACI Charts

\
Many organizations utilize RACI (Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed)\
charts to denote key responsibilities in business processes, projects, tasks, and other\
activities. A RACI chart assigns levels of responsibility to individuals and groups.\
The development of a RACI chart helps personnel determine roles for various business activities. A typical RACI chart follows

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The four roles in a RACI chart are defined as follows:\
• **Responsible** The person or group that performs the actual work or task.\
• **Accountable** The person who is ultimately answerable for complete,\
accurate, and timely execution of the work. Often this is a person who\
manages those in the Responsible role.\
• **Consulted** One or more people or groups consulted for their opinions,\
experience, or insight. People in the Consulted role may be a subject-matter\
expert for the work or task, or an owner, steward, or custodian of an asset\
associated with the work or task. Communication with the Consulted role\
is two-way.\
• **Informed** One or more people or groups informed by those in other roles.\
Depending on the process or task, people in the Informed role may be told\
of an activity before, during, or after its completion. Communication with\
the Informed role is one-way.



When assigning roles to individuals and groups in a RACI chart, several aspects\
must be considered, including the following:\
• Skills Some or all individuals in a team assignment, as well as specifically\
named individuals, need to have the skills, training, and competence to\
carry out tasks as required.\
• Segregation of duties Critical tasks, such as the user account provisioning\
RACI chart depicted earlier, must be free of segregation of duties conflicts.\
This means that two or more individuals or groups must be required to carry\
out a critical task. In this example, the requestor, approver, and provisioner\
cannot be the same person or group.\
• Conflict of interest Critical tasks must not be assigned to individuals or\
groups when such assignments will create conflicts of interest. For example,\
a user who is an approver cannot approve a request for their own access.\
In this case, a different person must approve the request while avoiding a\
segregation of duties conflict.



## Board of directors

An organization’s board of directors oversees activities in the organization. Depending on\
the type of organization, board members may be elected by shareholders or constituents,\
or they may be appointed. This role can be either paid or voluntary in nature.

Activities performed by the board of directors, as well as directors’ authority, are\
usually defined by a constitution, bylaws, or external regulation. The board is typically accountable to the organization’s owners or, in the case of a government body,\
to the electorate.\
In many cases, board members have fiduciary duty. This means they are accountable to shareholders or constituents to act in the organization’s best interests with\
no appearance of impropriety, conflict of interest, or ill-gotten profit resulting from\
their actions.

In nongovernment organizations (NGOs), the board of directors is responsible for\
appointing a chief executive officer (CEO) and possibly other executives. The CEO,\
then, is accountable to the board of directors and carries out the board’s directives.\
Board members may also be selected for any of the following reasons:\
• Investor representation One or more board members may be appointed by\
significant investors to give them control over the strategy and direction of the\
organization.\
• Business experience Board members bring outside business management\
experience, which helps them develop successful business strategies for the\
organization.\
• Access to resources Board members bring business connections, including\
additional investors, business partners, suppliers, or customers.



In its publication “Cyber-Risk Oversight 2020,” the National Association of\
Corporate Directors (NACD) has developed five principles regarding the importance\
of information security:\
• Principle 1: Directors need to understand and approach cybersecurity as a strategic,\
enterprise risk—not just as an IT risk.\
• Principle 2: Directors should understand the legal implications of cyber risks as\
they relate to their company’s specific circumstances.\
• Principle 3: Boards should have adequate access to cybersecurity expertise, and\
discussions about cyber-risk management should be given regular and adequate\
time on board meeting agendas.\
• Principle 4: Directors should set the expectation that management will establish\
an enterprise-wide cyber-risk management framework with adequate staffing\
and budget.\
• Principle 5: Board-management discussions about cyber risk should include\
identification and quantification of financial exposure to cyber risks and which\
risks to accept, mitigate, or transfer, such as through insurance, as well as specific\
plans associated with each approach.\

## Executive management

Executive management is responsible for carrying out directives issued by the board of\
directors. Information security management includes ensuring that sufficient organizational resources are devoted to implementing a security program and developing and\
maintaining security controls to protect critical assets.\
Executive management must ensure that priorities are balanced. In the case of IT\
and information security, these functions are usually tightly coupled but sometimes in\
conflict. IT’s primary mission is to develop and operate business-enabling capabilities\
through the use of information systems, while information security’s mission includes\
risk management, security, privacy, and compliance. Executive management must ensure\
that these two sometimes-conflicting missions are successful.\
Typical IT- and security-related executive position titles include the following:\
• **Chief information officer (CIO)** This is the topmost leader in a larger\
IT organization.\
• **Chief technical officer (CTO)** This position is usually responsible for an\
organization’s overall technology strategy. Depending upon the organization’s\
purpose, the CTO may be separate from IT.\
• **Chief information security officer (CISO)** This position is responsible for\
all aspects of data-related security. This usually includes incident management,\
disaster recovery, vulnerability management, and compliance. This role is typically\
separate from IT.

To ensure the success of the organization’s information security program, executive\
management should be involved in three key areas:\
• Ratify corporate security policy Security policies developed by the\
information security function should be visibly ratified or endorsed by\
executive management. This may take different forms, such as formal, minuted\
ratification in a governance meeting; a statement of the need for compliance\
along with a signature within the body of the security policy document; a\
separate memorandum to all personnel; or other visible communication to\
the organization’s rank and file that stresses the importance of, and need for\
compliance to, the organization’s information security policy.\
• Leadership by example With regard to information security policy, executive\
management should lead by example and not exhibit behavior suggesting they are\
“above” security policy—or other policies. Executives should not be seen to enjoy\
special privileges of the nature that suggest that one or more security policies do\
not apply to them. Instead, their behavior should visibly support security policies\
that all personnel are expected to comply with.\
• Ultimate responsibility Executives are ultimately responsible for all actions\
carried out by the personnel who report to them. Executives are also ultimately\
responsible for all outcomes related to organizations to which operations have\
been outsourced.



## Security Steering Committee

Many organizations form a security steering committee consisting of stakeholders\
from many (if not all) of the organization’s business units, departments, functions,\
and principal locations. A steering committee may have a variety of responsibilities,\
including the following:\
• **Risk treatment deliberation and recommendation** The committee may\
discuss relevant risks, discuss potential avenues of risk treatment, and develop\
recommendations for said risk treatment for ratification by executive management.\
• **Discussion and coordination of IT and security projects** Committee\
members may discuss various IT and security projects to resolve resource or\
scheduling conflicts. They may also discuss potential conflicts between multiple\
projects and initiatives and work out solutions.\
• **Review of recent risk assessments** The committee may discuss recent risk\
assessments to develop a common understanding of their results, and they may\
discuss remediation of findings.\
• **Discussion of new laws, regulations, and requirements** The committee may\
discuss new laws, regulations, and requirements that may impose changes in the\
organization’s operations. Committee members can develop high-level strategies\
that their respective business units or departments can further build out.

• **Review of recent security incidents** Steering committee members can\
discuss recent security incidents and their root causes. Often this can result in\
changes in processes, procedures, or technologies to reduce the risk and impact\
of future incidents

Reading between the lines, the primary mission of a security steering committee is to\
identify and resolve conflicts and to maximize the effectiveness of the security program,\
as balanced among other business initiatives and priorities.





## Business Process and Business Asset Owners

Business process and business asset owners are typically nontechnical personnel in\
management positions within an organization. Although they may not be technology\
experts, their business processes are often enhanced by IT in business applications and\
other capabilities in many organizations.

The responsibilities of business process and business asset owners include the following:\
• Access grants Asset owners decide whether individuals or groups should be\
given access to the asset and the level and type of access. Example access types\
include combinations of read-only, read-write, create, and delete.\
• Access revocation Asset owners should also decide when individuals or groups\
no longer require access to an asset, signaling the need to revoke that access.\
• Access reviews Asset owners should periodically review access lists to determine\
whether each person and group should continue to have access. Access reviews\
may also include access activity reviews to determine whether people who have\
not accessed assets still require access.\
• Configuration Asset owners determine the configuration needed for assets\
and applications, ensuring their proper function and support of applications and\
business processes.\
• Function definition In the case of business applications and services, asset\
owners determine which functions will be available, how they will work, and\
how they will support business processes. Typically, this definition is constrained\
by functional limitations within an application, service, or product.\
• Process definition Process owners determine the sequence, steps, roles, and\
actions carried out in their business processes.\
• Physical location Asset owners determine the physical location of their assets.\
Factors influencing choices of location include physical security, proximity to\
other assets, proximity to relevant personnel, and data protection and privacy laws.



## Custodial Responsibilities

\
In many organizations, asset owners are not involved in the day-to-day activities related\
to managing their assets, particularly when those assets are information systems and the\
data stored within them. Instead, somebody (or several people) in the IT organization\
acts as a proxy for asset owners and makes access grants and other decisions on their\
behalf. While this is a common practice, it is often carried too far, resulting in the asset\
owner being virtually uninvolved and uninformed. Instead, asset owners should be aware\
of, and periodically review, activities carried out by people, groups, and departments\
making decisions on their behalf.



## Chief Information Security Officer

\
The CISO is the highest-ranking security person in an organization. A CISO will\
develop business-aligned security strategies that support current and future business\
initiatives and will be responsible for developing and operating the organization’s\
information risk program, developing and implementing security policies, developing and implementing security incident response, and perhaps developing operational\
security functions.\
The CISO reports to the COO or the CEO in some organizations. In other organizations, the CISO may report to the CIO, chief legal counsel, or another person in\
the organization.\
Other similar titles with similar responsibilities include the following:\
• Chief security officer (CSO) This position generally has the responsibilities\
of a CISO, plus responsibilities for non-information assets such as business\
equipment and work centers. A CSO often is responsible for workplace safety.\
• Chief information risk officer (CIRO) Generally, this represents a change of\
approach to the CISO position, from protection-based to risk-based.\
• Chief risk officer (CRO) This position is responsible for all aspects of risk,\
including information, business, compliance, and market risk. This role is separate\
from IT. Note that some organizations have a chief revenue officer (also CRO);\
ensure that you understand how the organization structures its leadership roles.\
Many organizations do not have a CISO but instead have a director or manager of\
information security who reports to someone further down in the organization chart.

The one arena where a CISO may not be required is in small to medium-sized\
organizations where a full-time strategic leader may not be cost effective. It is advisable\
to contract with a virtual CISO (vCISO) to assist with strategy and planning. When\
organizations do not require or cannot afford a full-time person, this approach enables\
the organization to benefit from the knowledge of a seasoned security professional to\
assist in driving the information security program forward.



Rank Sets Tone and Gives Power\
A glance at the title of the highest-ranking information security position in a large\
organization reveals much about executive management’s opinion of information\
security. Executive attitudes about security are reflected in the security manager’s\
title and may resemble the following:\
• Security manager Information security is tactical and often viewed as\
consisting only of antivirus software and firewalls. The security manager has\
no visibility into the development of business objectives. Executives consider\
security as unimportant and based on technology only.\
• Security director Information security is essential and has moderate\
decision-making capability but little influence on the business. A directorlevel person in a larger organization may have little visibility of overall\
business strategies and little or no access to executive management or the\
board of directors.\
• Vice president Information security is strategic but does not influence\
business strategy and objectives. The vice president will have access to\
executive management and possibly the board of directors.\
• CISO/CIRO/CRO/CSO/vCISO Information security is strategic, and\
business objectives are developed with full consideration for risk. The\
C-level security person has free access to executive management and the\
board of directors.
