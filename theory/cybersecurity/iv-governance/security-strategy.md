# Security strategy

Security strategy is a high level plan that outlines an organizations approach to managing security risks and achieving its security objectives.

Steps to build security strategy

1. Identify the target state: define business requirements and objectives (ideal state).
2. Evaluate the current state: Assess the current security posture
3. Conduct gap analysis: identify the gaps between the current and desired states.
4. Develop the strategy: create a plan to remediate the gaps and align security with business objectives.
5. Create a security program: implement specific pojects and plans to enhance security controls.

Effective security strategy will:

* Be aligned with business strategy
* Well crafted to achieve the security objective
* Will consider assets and information inventory as a priority
* Will help in valuating the information assets
* Will promote the classification of information assets
* Will support the definition of roles and responsibilities, ownership and accountability.

## Conducting an effective gap analysis

1. Define the desired state (clear procedures, policies; well-defined roles and responsibilities for sec governance; effective security risk management framework; adequate resource allocation for sec initiatives; regular security awareness training for employees; compliance with relevant security regulations and standards).
2. Assess the current state (are security policies and procedures outdated, not clearly defined roles and responsibilities, risk management maturity and structure, resource allocation, security awareness training for employees, non compliance with regulation and standards).
3. Identify the gaps (differences between desired and current state)
4. Analyze the gaps&#x20;
5. Develop an action plan (present business case for increase of resources, trainings, develop roadmap for compliance)
