# Monitoring

The practice of monitoring responsibilities helps an organization confirm that the correct\
jobs are being carried out in the right way. There is no single approach, but several activities provide information to management, including the following:\
• Controls and internal audit Developing one or more controls around specific\
responsibilities gives management greater control over key activities. An internal\
audit of controls provides an objective analysis of control effectiveness.

• Metrics and reporting Developing metrics for repeated activities helps\
management better understand work output.\
• Work measurement This is a more structured activity used to measure\
repeated tasks carefully to help management better understand the volume\
of work performed.\
• Performance evaluation This is a traditional qualitative method used to evaluate\
employee performance.\
• 360 feedback Soliciting structured feedback from peers, subordinates, and\
management helps subjects and management better understand characteristics\
related to specific responsibilities.\
• Position benchmarking This technique is used by organizations that want to\
compare job titles and people holding them with those in other organizations.\
There is no direct monitoring of responsibilities. Instead, benchmarking helps an\
organization determine whether they have the right positions and are staffed by\
competent and qualified personnel. This may be useful for organizations that are\
troubleshooting employee performance.
