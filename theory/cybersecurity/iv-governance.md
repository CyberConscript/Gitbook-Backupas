# IV) Governance

## Role of governance

**Information security governanc**e typically focuses on several key processes, which include\
personnel management, sourcing, risk management, configuration management, change\
management, access management, vulnerability management, incident management,\
and business continuity planning.

**Information security governance is a set of established activities that helps management understand the state of the organization’s security program, its current risks, and its**\
**direct activities.** A goal of the security program is to continue to contribute toward the\
fulfillment of the security strategy, which itself will continue to align with the business\
and the business objectives.

The purpose of security governance is to align the organization’s security program\
with the needs of the business. Information security governance refers to a collection of\
top-down activities intended to control the security of the organization (and security related activities in every part of the organization) from a strategic perspective to ensure\
that information security supports the business. Following are some of the artifacts and\
actions that flow out of healthy security governance:\
• **Objectives** These desired capabilities or end states are ideally expressed in\
achievable, measurable terms.\
• **Strategy** This is a plan to achieve one or more objectives.\
• **Policy** At its minimum, security policy should directly reflect the mission,\
objectives, and goals of the overall organization.\
• **Priorities** The priorities in the security program should flow directly from the\
organization’s mission, objectives, and goals. Whatever is most important to the\
organization should also be essential to information security

• **Standards** The technologies, protocols, and practices used by IT should align\
with the organization’s needs. On their own, standards help drive a consistent\
approach to solving business challenges; the choice of standards should facilitate\
solutions that meet the organization’s needs in a cost-effective and secure manner.\
• **Processes** These formalized descriptions of repeated business activities include\
instructions to applicable personnel. Processes include one or more procedures\
and definitions of business records and other facts that help workers understand\
how things are supposed to be done.\
• **Controls** These are formal descriptions of critical activities to ensure desired\
outcomes\
• **Program and project management** The organization’s IT and security programs\
and projects should be organized and performed in a consistent manner that\
reflects business priorities and supports the business.\
• **Metrics**/**reporting** This includes the formal measurement of processes and\
controls so that management understands and can measure them.



## Governance roles and responsibilities

Within an effective security governance program, an organization’s senior management\
team will ensure that information systems necessary to support business operations will be\
adequately protected. These are some of the activities required to protect the organization:\
• **Risk management** Management will ensure that risk assessments are performed\
to identify risks in information systems and supported processes. Follow-up actions\
will be carried out to reduce the risk of system failure and compromise.\
• **Process improvement** Management will ensure that key changes will be made\
to business processes that will result in security improvements.\
• **Event identification** Management will put technologies and processes in place\
to ensure that security events and incidents will be identified as quickly as possible.\
• **Incident response** Management will put incident response procedures into\
place to help avoid incidents, reduce the impact and probability of incidents, and\
improve response to incidents to minimize their impact on the organization.\
• **Improved compliance** Management will identify all applicable laws, regulations,\
and standards and carry out activities to confirm that the organization can attain\
and maintain compliance.\
• **Business continuity and disaster recovery planning** Management will define\
objectives and allocate resources to develop business continuity and disaster\
recovery plans.\
• **Metrics Management** will establish processes to measure key security events such\
as incidents, policy changes and violations, audits, and training.\
• **Resource management** The allocation of workforce, budget, and other resources\
to meet security objectives is monitored by management.\
• **Improved IT governance** An effective security governance program will result\
in better strategic decisions in the IT organization that keep risks at an acceptably\
low level.

These and other governance activities are carried out through scripted interactions\
among key business and IT executives at regular intervals. Meetings will include a discussion of the impact of regulatory changes, alignment with business objectives, effectiveness\
of measurements, recent incidents, recent audits, and risk assessments.
