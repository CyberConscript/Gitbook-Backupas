# Pen testing

Automated vulnerability scanning does not test what a highly capable threat actor might be able to achieve. Penetration testing is a type of assessment that adopts known tactics and techniques to attempt intrusions.&#x20;

## Penetration Testing

A penetration test, often called a pen test or ethical hacking, utilizes authorized hacking techniques to uncover vulnerabilities in a target's security systems. The process of pen testing involves several steps:

1. **Verify Threat Existence:** Use methods like surveillance, social engineering, network scanners, and vulnerability assessment tools to identify potential vectors for exploiting vulnerabilities.
2. **Bypass Security Controls:** Search for ways to attack the system that might not be immediately apparent. For instance, if a strong firewall protects the network, explore the possibility of gaining physical access to a computer on-site and launching malware via a USB stick.
3. **Active Security Control Testing:** Actively probe security controls for configuration weaknesses and errors, such as weak passwords or software vulnerabilities.
4. **Exploit Vulnerabilities:** Demonstrate the high-risk nature of a vulnerability by exploiting it to gain unauthorized access to data or establish backdoors.

Unlike passive vulnerability assessment, a penetration test involves actively testing security controls and attempting to exploit identified vulnerabilities. Pen testing is an intrusive assessment technique. For instance, while a vulnerability scan might reveal an unpatched SQL Server susceptible to a known exploit, a penetration test would try to use the exploit to execute code injection, compromising the server. This demonstrates active testing of security controls. While the potential for an exploit may exist, real-world permissions on the server might prevent an attacker from successfully employing it. This aspect, which wouldn't be recognized by a vulnerability scan, is either verified or disproven through penetration testing.
