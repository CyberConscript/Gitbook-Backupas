# YARA

Yara can identify information based on both binary and textual patterns, such as hexadecimal and strings contained within a file.



## Yara rules

Every `yara` command requires two arguments to be valid, these are:\
1\) The rule file we create\
2\) Name of file, directory, or process ID to use the rule for.

Every rule must have a name and condition. For example, if we wanted to use "myrule.yar" on directory "some directory", we would use the following command:\
`yara myrule.yar somedirectory`



```yaml
rule examplerule {
        condition: true
}
```

The name of the rule in this snippet is `examplerule`, where we have one condition - in this case, the condition is `condition`. Simply, the rule we have made checks to see if the file/directory/PID that we specify exists via `condition: true`. If the file does exist, we are given the output of `examplerule.`
