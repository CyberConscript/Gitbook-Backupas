# YARA

Yara can identify information based on both binary and textual patterns, such as hexadecimal and strings contained within a file.



## Yara rules

Every `yara` command requires two arguments to be valid, these are:\
1\) The rule file we create\
2\) Name of file, directory, or process ID to use the rule for.

Every rule must have a name and condition. For example, if we wanted to use "myrule.yar" on directory "some directory", we would use the following command:\
`yara myrule.yar somedirectory`



```yaml
rule examplerule {
        condition: true
}
```

The name of the rule in this snippet is `examplerule`, where we have one condition - in this case, the condition is `condition`. Simply, the rule we have made checks to see if the file/directory/PID that we specify exists via `condition: true`. If the file does exist, we are given the output of `examplerule.`

## Yara Conditions

In this example, to make this string the condition, we need to use the variable's name

```yaml
rule helloworld_checker{
	strings:
		$hello_world = "Hello World!"

	condition:
		$hello_world
}


```

the condition `any of them` allows multiple strings to be searched for, like below:

```yaml
rule helloworld_checker{
	strings:
		$hello_world = "Hello World!"
		$hello_world_lowercase = "hello world"
		$hello_world_uppercase = "HELLO WORLD"

	condition:
		any of them
}
```



We have already used the `true` and `any of them` condition. Much like regular programming, you can use operators such as:

* <= (less than or equal to)
* \>= (more than or equal to)
* != (not equal to)
* and
* not
* or



```yaml
rule helloworld_checker{
	strings:
		$hello_world = "Hello World!"

	condition:
        #hello_world <= 10
}
```



The rule will now:

1\. Look for the "Hello World!" string\
2\. Only say the rule matches if there are less than or equal to ten occurrences of the "Hello World!" string
