# Social engineering

## **Social engineering**

**Social engineering** is a form of attack that exploits human nature and human behavior. The result of a successful social engineering attack is information leakage or the attacker being granted logical or physical access to a secure environment.

Here are some example scenarios of common social engineering attacks:&#x20;

* A worker receives an email warning about a dangerous new virus spreading across the Internet. The message directs the worker to do something malicious to his computer. This form of attack is known as a hoax.
* A website claims to offer free access to its products: movies, games, or books.
* If a worker receives a communication from someone asking to either reveal the names of actual employees or convince you to “provide assistance”.&#x20;
* When a contact on a discussion forum asks personal questions, such as your mother's maiden name, your primary school, history, interests, etc., these could be focused on learning the answers to password reset questions.

## Principles

&#x20;Social engineering works so well because we’re human. The principles of social engineering attacks are designed to focus on various aspects of human nature and take advantage of them. The following sections present common social engineering principles.&#x20;

**Authority**&#x20;

Authority is an effective technique because most people are likely to respond to authority with obedience. The trick is to convince the target that the attacker is someone with valid authority.&#x20;

**Intimidation**&#x20;

Intimidation can sometimes be seen as a derivative of the authority principle. Intimidation uses authority, confidence, or even the threat of harm to motivate someone to follow orders or instructions.

**Consensus**&#x20;

Consensus or social proof is the act of taking advantage of a person’s natural tendency to mimic what others are doing or are perceived as having done in the past. As a social engineering principle, the attacker attempts to convince the victim that a particular action or response is preferred to be consistent with social norms or previous occurrences.

**Scarcity**

Scarcity is a technique used to convince someone that an object has a higher value based on the object’s scarcity.&#x20;

**Familiarity**&#x20;

Familiarity or liking as a social-engineering principle attempts to exploit a person’s native trust in mutual friends or experiences or uses a facade to take on the identity of another company or person. If the target believes a message is from a known entity they’re much more likely to trust in the content and even act or respond.&#x20;

**Trust**&#x20;

Trust as a social engineering principle involves an attacker using a developed relationship with a victim. This may take seconds or months until the attacker attempts to use the value of the relationship to convince the victim to reveal information or perform an action.&#x20;

**Urgency**

Urgency often dovetails with scarcity, because the need to act quickly increases as scarcity indicates a greater risk of missing out. Urgency is often used as a method to get a quick response from a target before they have time to carefully consider or refuse compliance.\

Invoice scams

&#x20;Invoice scams are a social engineering attack that often attempts to steal funds from an organization or individuals through the presentation of a false invoice often followed by strong inducements to pay.&#x20;

## Whaling&#x20;

Whaling is a form of spear phishing that targets specific high-value individuals, such as the CEO or other C-level executives, administrators, or high-net-worth clients. Often the goal of a whaling attack is to steal credentials from the high-level target or to use that target to steal funds or redirect resources to the benefit of the attacker. Whaling is in a way the opposite of business email compromise or BEC for shorts.

## Business email compromise

BEC is often focused on convincing members of accounting or finance departments to transfer funds, pay invoices, or purchase products from a message that appears to originate from a boss, manager, or executive. Therefore, BEC is a form of spear phishing that is targeting employees of the same organization. BEC can also be called “CEO fraud” or “CEO spoofing.”

## Dumpster diving&#x20;

Dumpster diving is the act of digging through trash, discarded equipment, or abandoned locations to obtain information about a target organization or individual. Just about anything that is of any minor internal value or sensitivity could make social engineering attacks easier or more effective.&#x20;

## Shoulder surfing

Shoulder surfing occurs when someone is able to watch a user’s keyboard or view their display. Shoulder surfing defenses include dividing worker groups by sensitivity levels and limiting access to certain areas of the building using locked doors. Users should not work on sensitive data while in a public space. Another defense against shoulder surfing is the use of screen filters restricts the viewing angle so that only if a viewer is directly in front of the screen is the content visible.&#x20;

## Pharming

Pharming is the malicious redirection of a valid website’s URL or IP address to a fake website that hosts a false version of the original, valid site. This is often an element of a phishing attack, on-path attack, or Domain Name System (DNS) abuse. The pharming part of the attack is the redirection of traffic from a legitimate destination to a false one. The false target is often crafted to look and operate similar enough to the legitimate one to fool the victim for credential harvesting.

## Tailgating&#x20;

Tailgating occurs when an unauthorized entity gains access to a facility under the authorization of a valid worker but without their knowledge. An attacker may be able to sneak in behind a valid worker before the door closes. Tailgating is an attack that does not depend on the consent of the victim, just their obliviousness to what occurs behind them as they walk into a building. Each and every time a worker unlocks or opens a door, they should ensure that it is closed and locked before walking away. Company policy should be focused on changing user behavior toward more security, but realize that working against human nature is hard. These can include the use of access control vestibules, security cameras, and security guards.&#x20;

## Piggybacking

Piggybacking occurs when an unauthorized entity gains access to a facility under the authorization of a valid worker by tricking the victim into providing consent. This could happen when the intruder feigns the need for assistance by holding a large box or lots of paperwork and asks someone to “hold the door” or is in a brown jumpsuit and is carrying a package.&#x20;

## Prepending&#x20;

Prepending is the adding of a term, expression, or phrase to the beginning or header of a communication. An attacker could precede the subject of an attack email with RE: or FW: to make the receiver think the communication is the continuance of a previous conversation. Other often used prepending terms include EXTERNAL, PRIVATE, and INTERNAL. Prepending attacks may also be used to fool filters. \
\
Hoax&#x20;

A hoax is a form of social engineering designed to convince targets to delete files, change configuration settings, or install fraudulent security software. Hoax messages often encourage the victim to do malicious actions against himself. A hoax is a false warning, often contained in an email message claiming to come from the IT department. The hoax purports that there is a “deadly virus” circulating through the Internet and that the recipient should erase specific files or change security configurations, and then forward the message to other users. However, changing configurations allow an attacker to compromise the system. Or, erasing files may make the computer unstable, prompting the victim to call the telephone number in the hoax email message for help, which is actually the phone number of the attacker.

## Watering hole attack&#x20;

A watering hole attack is a form of targeted attack against a region, a group, or an organization. The attacker discovers a common resource that one or more members of the target use frequently. This location is planted with malware and can be considered a watering hole. When the target visits the poisoned watering hole, and they bring the infection back into the group or at least their system.&#x20;

## Typosquatting&#x20;

Typosquatting is a practice employed to take advantage of when a user mistypes the domain name or IP address of an intended resource. A squatter predicts URL typos and then registers those domain names to direct traffic to their own site. The variations used for typosquatting include common misspellings (such as googel.com), typing errors (such as gooogle.com), variations on a name or word (for example, plurality, as in googles.com), and different top-level domains (TLDs) such as google.edu.  These fake sites exist because attackers purchase the domain names of sites that are spelled similarly to actual sites. This is called typo squatting or URL hijacking.

## URL hijacking

This refers to the practice of displaying a link or advertisement that looks like that of a well-known product, service, or site, but when clicked redirects the user to an alternate location, service, or product.&#x20;

## Clickjacking

It is a means to redirect a user’s click or selection on a web page to an alternate often malicious target instead of the intended and desired location.



## Pretexting&#x20;

A pretext is a false believable story you are told to convince you to act or respond in favor of the attacker.&#x20;

## Influence campaigns&#x20;

Influence campaigns are social engineering attacks that attempt to guide, adjust, or change public opinion. Waged by nation-states against their real or perceived foreign enemies. Linked to the distribution of disinformation, propaganda, false information, “fake news,” and even the activity of doxing, to adjust the perception of readers and viewers to the concepts, thoughts, and ideologies of the influencer.

## &#x20;Doxing&#x20;

Is the collection of information about an individual or an organization to disclose for the purpose of changing opinions. Doxing can include withholding of information that contradicts the intended narrative of the attacker. Doxing can fabricate or alter information to place false accusations against the target.

## Hybrid warfare

Combination of classical military strategy with modern capabilities, including digital influence campaigns, psychological warfare efforts, political tactics, and cyber warfare capabilities. With cyberwar and influence campaigns, every person can be targeted and potentially harmed. Harm is not just physical in hybrid warfare; it can also damage reputation, finances, digital infrastructure, and relationships.

## Social media&#x20;

Social media has become a weapon used by anyone wanting to control information, distribute propaganda, or change public opinion. Must to be skeptical of everything that reaches us through our digital communication devices. Social media can be a distraction as well as a potential vulnerability to an organization. The company’s acceptable user policy (AUP) should indicate that workers need to focus on work while at work.&#x20;

## Defense against SE

\
Methods to protect against social engineering include the following:&#x20;

* &#x20;Authentication when performing activities for personnel over the phone
* Information classification&#x20;
* Always verifying the service call was placed by authorized personnel
* Never following the instructions of an email without verifying the information with at least two independent and trusted sources
* If several workers report to the help desk of the same odd event, such as a call or email, an investigation should look into what was the contact about, who initiated it, and what was the intention or purpose&#x20;
* Always be on the side of paranoia and suspicion when dealing with anyone you don’t know or recognize, whether in person, over the phone, or over the Internet/network
* End users should be trained to avoid clicking any link received via email, IM, or social network message.
* Use of spam email filter or rule and antivirus (AV) scanners. If a message is received from one of the listed spam sources, the email filter blocks or discards it. (Sender Policy Framework (SPF), Domain Keys Identified Mail (DKIM), and Domain Message)
* Detecting or blocking spoofed messages: checking source addresses against blocklists and filtering on invalid entries in a message header.
* Users should not work on sensitive data while in a public space.
* Use of physical means: access control vestibules, security cameras, and security guards.&#x20;
* Workers need to be informed of the proper channels to receive invoices and the means to validate invoices. Any invoice that is not expected or otherwise abnormal should trigger a face-to-face discussion with the supervisor or other financial executive.
* Use a unique, long, and complex password, at each and every site and for each and every app.
* Use multifactor authentication (MFA)
* Block access to social media sites by adding IP blocks to firewalls and resolution filters to DNS.

The only direct defense against social engineering attacks is user education and awareness training.
