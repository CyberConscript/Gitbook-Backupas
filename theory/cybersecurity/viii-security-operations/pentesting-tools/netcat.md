# Netcat

`Netcat` (often abbreviated as `nc`) is a versatile networking tool that can be used for various purposes, including port scanning, transferring files, creating simple chat servers, and establishing reverse and bind shells. Below are some commonly used parameters for `netcat`:

#### **Basic Parameters**

* `-l`: **Listen mode**. Tells `netcat` to listen for incoming connections. This is often used on the server side (e.g., in bind shell setups).
* `-p [port]`: **Port**. Specifies the port to listen on (when used with `-l`) or the port to connect to on the target machine.
* `-e [program]`: **Execute**. Executes the specified program after a connection is established. Commonly used to run a shell (e.g., `/bin/bash` on Linux) in shell scenarios.
* `-v`: **Verbose mode**. Makes `netcat` more talkative, providing detailed output about what it's doing.
* `-n`: **Numeric-only IP addresses**. Tells `netcat` to avoid DNS lookups and use only numeric IP addresses.
* `-z`: **Zero-I/O mode**. Used for scanning purposes; `netcat` doesn't send any data, just attempts to open a connection. This is often used for port scanning.
* `-w [timeout]`: **Timeout**. Sets a timeout value for connections or listening. It can be useful when you want the connection to time out after a certain period.
* `-u`: **UDP mode**. By default, `netcat` operates over TCP, but this option tells it to use UDP instead.
* `-k`: **Keep listening**. When combined with `-l`, this keeps `netcat` listening after a connection is closed, allowing multiple connections (useful for persistent bind shells or chat servers).
* `-c`: **Send CRLF as line-ending**. This is used when communicating with certain types of servers that require carriage return and line feed (CRLF) at the end of lines.
