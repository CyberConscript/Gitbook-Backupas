# File integrity monitoring

File Integrity Monitoring (FIM) is a security measure that involves monitoring and validating the integrity of files and system components to detect unauthorized changes, modifications, or deletions. FIM helps organizations ensure the security and compliance of their systems by providing real-time alerts and reports on any alterations to critical files or configurations.

#### Key Features and Aspects of File Integrity Monitoring:

1. **Baseline Establishment:**
   * FIM begins by establishing a baseline of the normal state of files and configurations on a system. This baseline represents the expected and authorized state of the system.
2. **Continuous Monitoring:**
   * FIM continuously monitors files, directories, and system configurations for any changes. This includes modifications to file content, permissions, attributes, or the addition/deletion of files.
3. **Real-Time Alerts:**
   * If FIM detects any unauthorized or unexpected changes, it generates real-time alerts or notifications. These alerts are crucial for immediate response to potential security incidents.
4. **Configuration and Policy Management:**
   * FIM solutions often allow administrators to define policies and rules for file integrity. These policies specify what changes are considered acceptable and which ones should trigger alerts.
5. **Automation and Remediation:**
   * Some advanced FIM solutions may include automated remediation capabilities. If unauthorized changes are detected, the system can automatically restore files to their baseline state or take predefined corrective actions.
6. **Audit Trails and Reporting:**
   * FIM generates audit trails and reports detailing changes to files and configurations over time. These reports are valuable for compliance purposes and forensic analysis.
7. **Critical System Components:**
   * FIM typically focuses on monitoring critical system components, including operating system files, application binaries, configuration files, registry settings (for Windows systems), and other sensitive data.
8. **Use Cases:**
   * FIM is used for a variety of purposes, including detecting and preventing unauthorized changes, identifying and responding to security incidents, ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements, and protecting against insider threats.

#### Implementation of File Integrity Monitoring:

1. **Agent-Based Approach:**
   * FIM agents are deployed on individual systems or endpoints to monitor file integrity locally. These agents communicate with a centralized FIM server to aggregate and analyze data.
2. **Agentless Approach:**
   * Some FIM solutions operate in an agentless mode, leveraging existing system logs, security information and event management (SIEM) systems, or other methods to monitor file integrity without installing dedicated agents.
3. **Regular Scans or Real-Time Monitoring:**
   * FIM can operate through regular scheduled scans to check file integrity at predefined intervals. Alternatively, some solutions offer real-time monitoring to detect changes immediately.
4. **Integration with Security Ecosystem:**
   * FIM solutions often integrate with other security technologies, such as SIEM systems, intrusion detection systems (IDS), and security orchestration, automation, and response (SOAR) platforms for a comprehensive security posture.
5. **Customizable Policies:**
   * FIM solutions allow administrators to define and customize policies based on the specific security and compliance requirements of the organization.
6. **Encryption Considerations:**
   * FIM should consider how to handle encrypted files. Some solutions support file integrity monitoring for encrypted files, while others may focus on monitoring the encryption keys and decryption processes.

File Integrity Monitoring is a critical component of a robust cybersecurity strategy, providing visibility and control over changes to essential system components. It helps organizations maintain a secure and compliant IT environment by quickly detecting and responding to unauthorized alterations.
