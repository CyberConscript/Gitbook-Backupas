# Exploitation Frameworks

An exploitation framework leverages vulnerabilities identified by an automated scanner and deploys scripts or software to initiate matching exploits. This process could result in significant disruption to the target, potentially causing service failures and jeopardizing data security.

The framework encompasses a repository of exploit codes, each tailored to exploit a specific Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE). These exploit codes can be combined with modular payloads. Depending on the level of access attained via the exploit, the payload code may be employed to establish a command shell, create a user account, install software, and more. The customized exploit module is then injected into the target system. Additionally, the framework might possess the capability to obfuscate the code, allowing it to bypass intrusion detection systems or antivirus software.

The most widely recognized exploit framework is **Metasploit** (metasploit.com). This platform is open-source software, currently maintained by Rapid7. It offers a free community edition with a command-line interface, available for Linux and Windows. Rapid7 also provides professional and express commercial editions of the framework, which can be seamlessly integrated with the Nexpose vulnerability scanner.

**Sn1per** (github.com/1N3/Sn1per) is a framework designed for generating penetration test reports and collecting evidence. It can collaborate with other tools such as Metasploit and Nikto to execute automated test suites. Results can be presented as web-based reports.

Numerous other exploitation frameworks target various types of vulnerabilities. A few examples include:

**fireELF**—injecting fileless exploit payloads into a Linux host (github.com/rek7/fireELF).&#x20;

**RouterSploit**—vulnerability scanning and exploit modules targeting embedded systems (github.com/threat9/routersploit).&#x20;

**Browser Exploitation Framework (BeEF)**—extracting web session information and exploiting client-side scripting (beefproject.com).&#x20;

**Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP)**—comprising scanning tools and scripts for testing web application and mobile app security (owasp.org/www-project-zap).&#x20;

**Pacu**—encompassing scanning and exploit tools for reconnaissance and exploitation of Amazon Web Service (AWS) accounts (rhinosecuritylabs.com/aws/pacu-open-source-aws-exploitation-framework).
