# The Diamond Model

The diamond model looks at intrusion analysis and tracking attack groups over time. It focuses on four key areas, each representing a different point on the diamond. These are:

* Adversary: The focus here is on the threat actor behind an attack and allows analysts to identify the motive behind the attack.
* Victim: The opposite end of adversary looks at an individual, group or organisation affected by an attack.
* Infrastructure: The adversaries' tools, systems, and software to conduct their attack are the main focus. Additionally, the victim's systems would be crucial to providing information about the compromise.
* Capabilities: The focus here is on the adversary's approach to reaching its goal. This looks at the means of exploitation and the TTPs implemented across the attack timeline
