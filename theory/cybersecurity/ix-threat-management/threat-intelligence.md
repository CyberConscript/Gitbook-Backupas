# Threat intelligence

**Threat Research and Intelligence:** Threat research involves the systematic study of cyber adversaries' tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) to understand their methods and motives. Security companies and researchers actively engage in threat research to gather insights into modern cyber threats and develop effective countermeasures.

**Sources of Threat Intelligence:**

1. **Security Solution Providers:**
   * Security companies that offer firewall, anti-malware, and other cybersecurity solutions collect data from their customers' networks.
   * Analyzing customer data helps identify TTPs, indicators of compromise (IoCs), and patterns of attack.
   * These insights are used to improve security products and share threat intelligence with the wider community.
2. **Honeynets:**
   * Organizations set up honeynets, which are controlled environments designed to attract cyber attackers.
   * By observing attackers' interactions with the honeynet, researchers gain valuable insights into their strategies and methods.
3. **Deep Web and Dark Web:**
   * **Deep Web:** It includes parts of the internet that are not indexed by search engines, like password-protected pages or unlinked content.
   * **Dark Net:** An overlay network (e.g., TOR) that anonymizes users and prevents third-party analysis of network activity.
   * **Dark Web:** Sites, content, and services only accessible through dark nets. Often, access requires knowledge of the URL through word-of-mouth channels.

Threat intelligence collected from various sources helps organizations understand emerging threats, develop proactive defenses, and enhance incident response capabilities. It's a critical component of modern cybersecurity efforts, enabling better protection against ever-evolving cyber threats.



## **Dark Web as a Source of Counterintelligence:**

1. **Anonymity and Infiltration:**
   * The anonymity provided by dark web services offers investigators an opportunity to gather counterintelligence.
   * Investigators can infiltrate forums and webstores that facilitate the exchange of stolen data and hacking tools.
   * This infiltration helps gather valuable insights into cybercriminal activities, their methods, and potential targets.
2. **Exchange of Stolen Data and Tools:**
   * Cybercriminals often use the dark web to trade in stolen data, credentials, and hacking tools.
   * Investigating these exchanges allows law enforcement to track down stolen information and apprehend those responsible.

## **Adversarial Response and Shifting Landscape:**

1. **Adversary Reaction:**
   * As law enforcement agencies infiltrate dark web platforms, adversaries adapt their strategies to counter these efforts.
   * Adversaries may set up new networks, adopt better security practices, and change communication methods to evade detection.
2. **Identifying Infiltration:**
   * Adversaries develop techniques to identify potential law enforcement infiltration within their networks and communications.
   * This ongoing cat-and-mouse game forces investigators to continuously adapt and evolve their methods.
3. **Dynamic Landscape:**
   * Dark nets and the dark web are dynamic environments that constantly change due to the efforts of both investigators and adversaries.
   * The evolving nature of these networks makes them a challenging yet valuable source of intelligence.

Investigating the dark web requires a combination of technical expertise, strategic planning, and adaptability. As law enforcement and cybersecurity professionals navigate this intricate landscape, they gather insights that contribute to understanding cyber threats, identifying threat actors, and enhancing overall cybersecurity efforts.



## **Forms of Threat Intelligence:**

1. **Behavioral Threat Research:**
   * This form involves providing narrative commentary that describes real-world examples of cyber attacks and the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) employed by threat actors.
   * It offers insights into how attacks are carried out and helps organizations understand the modus operandi of cyber adversaries.
2. **Reputational Threat Intelligence:**
   * Reputational threat intelligence consists of lists of IP addresses, domains, and signatures associated with malicious behavior.
   * These indicators help security systems identify and block traffic or files linked to known threats.
3. **Threat Data:**
   * Threat data comprises computer data that correlates observed events on a customer's network and logs with known threat indicators and TTPs.
   * It helps identify potentially malicious activities and provides context for understanding threats.

## Commercial models of TI

Threat intelligence platforms and feeds are supplied as one of four different commercial models:

### **Closed/Proprietary Model for Threat Intelligence Platforms:**

In the closed/proprietary model, threat research and CTI data are offered through paid subscription services provided by commercial threat intelligence platforms. This model ensures that subscribers receive exclusive access to valuable threat intelligence insights, analysis, and indicators of cyber threats. The key features of this model include:

1. **Paid Subscription Access:**
   * Organizations or individuals interested in accessing threat intelligence data need to subscribe to the platform by paying a fee.
   * Subscription grants access to a range of threat intelligence feeds, insights, and analysis.
2. **Early Access to Valuable Research:**
   * Commercial threat intelligence platforms often release their most valuable research to subscribers before making it publicly available.
   * Subscribers get a competitive advantage by receiving early insights into emerging threats and vulnerabilities.
3. **Resourceful Content:**
   * Besides threat intelligence feeds, platforms often offer additional content like blogs, white papers, webinars, and reports.
   * These resources provide subscribers with in-depth knowledge about the latest threats, attack techniques, and mitigation strategies.

**Examples of Closed/Proprietary Threat Intelligence Platforms:**

1. **IBM X-Force Exchange:**
   * IBM X-Force Exchange offers a comprehensive threat intelligence platform that provides subscribers with valuable insights into emerging cyber threats.
   * Subscribers gain access to indicators of compromise, threat research, and analysis.
2. **Mandiant:**
   * Mandiant, a FireEye company, offers a subscription-based threat intelligence service.
   * Subscribers receive advanced threat intelligence, expert analysis, and customized reports to enhance their cybersecurity strategies.
3. **Recorded Future:**
   * Recorded Future provides a platform for threat intelligence analysis and prediction.
   * Subscribers gain insights into threats and vulnerabilities, empowering them to proactively respond to potential cyber threats.

The closed/proprietary model ensures that organizations receive high-quality, timely, and exclusive threat intelligence data, allowing them to enhance their security posture, detect threats early, and respond effectively to evolving cyber threats.
