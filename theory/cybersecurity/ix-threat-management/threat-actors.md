# Threat actors

## Threat actors

Threat actors are individuals, groups, or entities that engage in malicious activities to compromise the security of systems, data, or operations. Threat actors can have various attributes that help classify and understand their motivations, capabilities, and methods.

1. **Motivation:**
   * Financial Gain: Threat actors motivated by monetary rewards, such as cybercriminals involved in cyber extortion, ransomware attacks, and financial fraud.
   * Political or Ideological Agenda: Hacktivists or politically motivated threat actors who target organizations or governments to advance their social or political causes.
   * Espionage: Nation-state actors or advanced persistent threats (APTs) that engage in cyber espionage to gather intelligence, intellectual property, or sensitive data.
   * Notoriety: Threat actors seeking recognition or attention by conducting high-profile attacks to gain visibility within the cybersecurity community.
   * Competitive Advantage: Competitors or business rivals attempting to gain an edge by stealing proprietary information or disrupting business operations.
   * Insider.&#x20;
2. **Skill Level:**
   * Script Kiddies: Individuals with limited technical skills who use readily available tools and scripts to launch attacks.
   * Hackers: Skilled individuals with technical expertise who exploit vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access.
   * Advanced Threat Actors: Highly skilled and well-resourced groups capable of conducting sophisticated attacks, such as nation-state actors or organized cybercriminal syndicates.
3. **Resources:**
   * Individuals: Solo hackers or enthusiasts operating alone.
   * Groups or Organizations: Cybercriminal organizations, hacktivist collectives, or nation-state-sponsored groups.
   * State Actors: Nation-states that conduct cyber operations for various strategic purposes.
4. **Methods and Techniques:**
   * Phishing: Using deceptive emails or messages to trick individuals into revealing sensitive information or downloading malicious software.
   * Malware: Creating and deploying malicious software like viruses, worms, Trojans, and ransomware.
   * Exploits: Leveraging known vulnerabilities to compromise systems.
   * Social Engineering: Manipulating individuals to divulge confidential information or perform actions that compromise security.
   * Zero-Day Exploits: Targeting undisclosed vulnerabilities that have not yet been patched by software vendors.
5. **Geographical Origin:**
   * Attribution: Determining the country or region from which the threat actor is operating.
   * Nation-State or Non-State: Distinguishing between state-sponsored actors and non-governmental threat actors.
6. **Targets:**
   * Industry Sectors: Targeting specific sectors, such as financial, healthcare, government, energy, etc.
   * Individual Organizations: Focusing on specific companies, institutions, or government agencies.

## APT

Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) are sophisticated and highly targeted cyberattacks conducted by well-funded threat actors with the goal of infiltrating and maintaining long-term unauthorized access to a specific target's network, systems, and data. APTs are characterized by their persistence, stealth, and advanced techniques, and they often involve nation-state actors, organized cybercriminal groups, or industrial espionage entities.

Key characteristics of Advanced Persistent Threats include:

1. **Advanced Techniques:** APTs employ advanced and sophisticated techniques, including zero-day vulnerabilities, custom malware, rootkits, and other cutting-edge tools. These techniques are designed to evade traditional security measures and detection mechanisms.
2. **Long-Term Persistence:** Unlike conventional cyberattacks that aim for quick gains, APTs are focused on establishing a persistent presence within the target's environment. This allows threat actors to gather valuable information over an extended period.
3. **Targeted Approach:** APTs are not random attacks; they are tailored to a specific target, often a high-value organization, government agency, or industry sector. Threat actors invest time in reconnaissance to understand the target's environment and vulnerabilities.
4. **Multiple Attack Phases:** APTs typically involve a series of coordinated attack phases, including initial compromise, establishing a foothold, lateral movement, data exfiltration, and maintaining persistence. These phases are executed in a stealthy and controlled manner.
5. **Custom Malware:** APTs often use custom-designed malware, which makes it difficult for traditional antivirus solutions to detect. This malware is created specifically for the target's environment and is often used sparingly to avoid detection.
6. **C\&C Infrastructure:** APTs use command and control (C\&C) infrastructure to communicate with compromised systems and manage their operations. This infrastructure is designed to be resilient and adaptable to avoid takedown efforts.
7. **Spear Phishing:** A common entry point for APTs is spear phishing, where attackers craft highly convincing and personalized emails to trick targeted individuals into clicking on malicious links or attachments.
8. **Data Exfiltration:** Once inside the target's network, APTs focus on stealthily exfiltrating sensitive data. They may use encryption, steganography, and other methods to avoid detection.
9. **Geopolitical Motivation:** While financial gain is a common motivation for cybercriminals, APTs often have geopolitical objectives, such as intelligence gathering, political influence, espionage, or disruption of critical infrastructure.
10. **Difficult Attribution:** APTs are designed to be difficult to attribute to specific threat actors or organizations. Attackers may use proxy servers, compromised infrastructure, and other tactics to obscure their origin.

## Insider

_A current or former employee, contractor, or business partner who has or had authorized access to an organization’s network, system, or data and intentionally exceeded or misused that access in a manner that negatively affected the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of the organization’s information or information systems._\

Insider threats are security risks that arise from individuals within an organization who have privileged access to its systems, data, and resources. These threats can be categorized into two main types: intentional insider threats and unintentional insider threats.&#x20;

**1. Intentional Insider Threats:** Intentional insider threats occur when individuals within the organization purposefully engage in malicious activities to cause harm, steal sensitive information, or disrupt operations. These individuals may have various motivations, including financial gain, revenge, ideological beliefs, or personal vendettas. Intentional insider threats can be further classified into two subtypes:

* **Malicious Insiders:** These are employees, contractors, or business partners who intentionally misuse their authorized access to carry out harmful activities. Examples include stealing intellectual property, deleting critical data, or launching cyberattacks from within the organization.
* **External Collaborators:** These are individuals from external organizations who are granted temporary access to an organization's systems or data. They may exploit their access for malicious purposes, such as stealing sensitive information or conducting cyber espionage on behalf of their own organization.

**2. Unintentional Insider Threats:** Unintentional insider threats, also known as accidental or negligent insiders, occur when individuals within the organization inadvertently cause security breaches or incidents due to their actions or mistakes. These threats are not motivated by malice but are the result of errors, lack of awareness, or poor security practices. Unintentional insider threats can include:

* **Data Mishandling:** Accidentally sharing sensitive information with unauthorized individuals, misplacing devices containing sensitive data, or sending confidential information to the wrong recipients.
* **Phishing and Social Engineering:** Falling victim to phishing emails or social engineering tactics that trick individuals into divulging sensitive information or performing harmful actions.
* **Misconfigurations:** Incorrectly configuring security settings, permissions, or access controls, leading to unintended exposure of sensitive data or systems.
* **Inadequate Security Awareness:** Lack of awareness about security best practices, policies, and procedures, resulting in inadvertent security breaches.

Addressing insider threats requires a combination of technical controls, policies, and training:

* **Access Controls:** Implementing strong access controls, least privilege principles, and role-based access to limit individuals' access to only what is necessary for their roles.
* **User Monitoring:** Employing monitoring solutions to detect unusual or suspicious activities by authorized users.
* **Security Training:** Providing regular security awareness training to educate employees about cybersecurity risks, best practices, and how to identify phishing attempts.
* **Policy Enforcement:** Enforcing strict security policies regarding data handling, device usage, and acceptable use of company resources.
* **Incident Response:** Establishing well-defined incident response plans to quickly mitigate the impact of insider threats when they occur.

Combating insider threats requires a holistic approach that combines technology, policy, and human factors to create a security-conscious organizational culture.
