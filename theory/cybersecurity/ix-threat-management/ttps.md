# TTPs

Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) and Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)

Tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) encompass a broad understanding of adversary behavior, drawing inspiration from US military doctrine. TTPs classify adversary actions based on campaign strategy and approach (tactics), broad attack methods (techniques), and specific intrusion tools and methodologies (procedures).

An indicator of compromise (IoC) is a residual clue indicating a successful or ongoing attack against an asset or network. Put differently, an IoC serves as evidence of a TTP in action.

Given the diverse array of targets and attack vectors, the variety of potential IoCs is equally extensive. The following is a compilation of IoCs that may come into play:

* Unauthorized software and files
* Suspicious emails
* Suspicious registry and file system changes
* Unknown port and protocol usage
* Excessive bandwidth usage
* Rogue hardware
* Service disruption and defacement
* Suspicious or unauthorized account usage

While an IoC can sometimes be concrete and objectively identifiable, such as a malware signature, more frequently IoCs are effectively described through the amalgamation of multiple data points. As IoCs are often discerned through patterns of atypical activities rather than isolated events, their interpretation can be subject to variation and, consequently, diagnosing them might be time-consuming. In response, threat intelligence platforms employ AI-driven analysis to expedite detection while mitigating the potential inundation of analysts with false positives.

To be precise, an IoC serves as evidence of a triumphant attack. Occasionally, the term "indicator of attack" (IoA) is used to signify evidence of an ongoing intrusion attempt.
