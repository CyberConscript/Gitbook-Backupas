# Threat Hunting

## Threat Hunting

While vulnerability scanning relies on predefined lists of patches and standard baseline configurations, threat hunting takes a proactive approach by utilizing insights derived from threat intelligence to search for potential evidence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) already present within a network or system. This stands in contrast to a reactive process that only activates when alert conditions are triggered through an incident management system. Additionally, threat hunting differs from penetration testing. While penetration testing aims to breach a system or demonstrate vulnerabilities, threat hunting is centered on analyzing data within the system itself, making it less disruptive than penetration testing.

Typically led by senior security analysts, a threat hunting project involves several key considerations:

* **Advisories and Bulletins:** Threat hunting demands clear objectives and ample resources due to its resource-intensive nature. Often guided by hypotheses concerning potential threats, it can be triggered by security advisories and bulletins from vendors and researchers. These notifications about new Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) and vulnerabilities can initiate a threat hunting initiative. For instance, if intelligence reveals undetected malware infecting Windows desktops across multiple organizations, a threat hunting plan could be devised to check for its presence in your systems.
* **Intelligence Fusion and Threat Data:** Manual analysis of network and log data for threat hunting is time-consuming. Organizations equipped with a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system and threat analytics platform can utilize intelligence fusion. This technique involves updating the analytics platform with TTP and Indicator of Compromise (IoC) threat data feeds. Analysts then create queries to correlate this threat data with on-premises network traffic and log data. AI-assisted analysis and correlation might be used to expedite this process.
* **Maneuver:** When investigating live threats, it's essential to consider the adversarial nature of hacking. Competent threat actors often anticipate the possibility of threat hunting and employ countermeasures to avoid detection. For instance, they might initiate a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack to divert attention and expedite their objectives. "Maneuver," borrowed from military doctrine, refers to gaining tactical advantage. In cybersecurity, it means using strategic actions to outsmart threat actors. In threat hunting, defensive maneuvering could include passive discovery methods to prevent threat actors from realizing their intrusion has been detected until a containment and recovery plan is in place.
