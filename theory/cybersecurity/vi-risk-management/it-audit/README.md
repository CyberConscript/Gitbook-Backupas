# IT audit

Remember that the key is to align an audit approach with business objectives.

1. The planning phase: This initial stage involves determining an audit’s objectives, scope, and methodology. An IT auditor assesses the IT environment, identifies key risk areas, and plans their approach accordingly. For instance, they might focus on specific systems known for their sensitivity or complexity.
2. The fieldwork phase: In this phase, auditors collect data, conduct tests, and analyze findings. They might use various techniques such as interviews, document reviews, and system testing to gather evidence – for example, testing access controls in an application to ensure that only authorized users can modify critical data.
3. The reporting phase: The findings and insights gathered during the fieldwork are compiled in a report. This report provides an overview of the audit results, including identified issues and recommendations for improvement. It’s essential for communicating the audit’s value and guiding future action.
4. The follow-up phase: This final stage involves tracking the implementation of audit recommendations. Auditors can revisit the audited areas to ensure that corrective actions have been effectively implemented and that they provide the intended benefits.

The process typically consists of the following primary stages:

* **Planning:** The auditor determines the audit’s scope, objectives, and timelines. This stage involves understanding the organisation’s IT environment – including infrastructure, systems, applications, security measures, and data management practices – and identifying potential risks and controls to be evaluated.
* **Information gathering:** The auditor collects relevant data, background information, and documentation to thoroughly understand the organisation’s IT processes and systems. This process typically involves interviewing key personnel, reviewing resource documentation, analysing procedures and policies, and examining the control environment.
* **Risk assessment and control evaluation:** The auditor identifies and assesses the risks and vulnerabilities within the organisation’s IT infrastructure, processes, and systems based on the information gathered. This process includes evaluating the effectiveness of internal controls, security measures, and compliance with applicable policies, regulations, and industry standards.
* **Testing:** The auditor performs detailed tests on selected systems, applications, specific processes or control procedures to validate their effectiveness, accuracy, and compliance. Testing methods may include data analysis, vulnerability scanning, penetration testing, controls testing, or sampling, depending on the audit objectives and the audited systems.
* **Analysis and findings:** The auditor analyses the testing and evaluation results, identifies deviations, irregularities, or vulnerabilities, and evaluates the implications. Auditors determine if systems are configured securely, IT processes are effective and compliant, or risks are adequately mitigated.
* **Reporting:** After the analysis, the auditor documents the findings and conclusions, makes recommendations for improvement where necessary, and prepares a formal audit report. This report is then shared with the management, the audit committee, or other stakeholders as required, helping them understand the organisation’s risk exposure, compliance, and effectiveness of IT processes and controls.
* **Follow-up:** In some cases, a follow-up may be performed to evaluate if the recommended improvements and corrective actions have been implemented and ensure their effectiveness in addressing the identified issues.
