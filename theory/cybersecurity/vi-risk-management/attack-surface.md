# Attack surface

Understanding attack vectors helps security professionals identify potential threats, anticipate potential weaknesses, and implement appropriate defenses. By addressing vulnerabilities associated with known attack vectors, organizations can significantly enhance their cybersecurity posture and reduce the risk of successful attacks.

## Attack surface

**Attack Surface:** The attack surface refers to the sum total of all the ways in which an attacker could potentially enter or interact with a system, network, or application. The attack surface encompasses all potential points where malicious threat actors could exploit vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access. The evaluation of the attack surface takes into account the type of threat actor and can differ for external and insider threats. A larger attack surface implies more potential points of entry for attackers. Reducing the attack surface involves minimizing unnecessary entry points, removing unnecessary functionalities, and implementing security measures to mitigate vulnerabilities.

For example, in a computer system, the attack surface might include open ports, user inputs, network connections, APIs, third-party libraries, and more. The goal of security professionals is to manage and reduce the attack surface to minimize the potential for unauthorized access and cyberattacks.

* **External Actor vs. Insider Threat:** The attack surface for an external actor is typically smaller than that for an insider threat. External attackers have limited access points, while insiders often have broader access within the organization.
* **Network and Software Applications:** The attack surface can be evaluated for an entire network as well as individual software applications. Minimizing the attack surface involves restricting access to a few known endpoints, protocols, services, and methods, each of which must be assessed for vulnerabilities.

## **Attack Vectors**

**Attack Vectors:** Attack vectors are specific paths or methods that attackers use to exploit vulnerabilities and gain unauthorized access to a system. They are the means by which attackers carry out their attacks using the vulnerabilities present in the attack surface. Attack vectors can take various forms, including:

* **Phishing Emails:** Trick users into revealing sensitive information or downloading malicious attachments.
* **Malware Infections:** Deliver malware through infected files, links, or malicious websites.
* **Brute Force Attacks:** Attempt to gain access by systematically trying all possible combinations of passwords.
* **SQL Injection:** Exploit vulnerabilities in web applications' input fields to execute malicious SQL commands.
* **Social Engineering:** Manipulate individuals into divulging confidential information or performing actions that compromise security.
* **Insider Threats:** Exploit privileges of trusted insiders to carry out attacks from within the organization.
* **Direct Access:** Physical or local attacks where the threat actor exploits unlocked workstations, boot disks, or stolen devices to install malicious tools.
* **Removable Media:** Concealing malware on removable media like USB drives to trick users into connecting the media, potentially running malware.
* **Remote and Wireless:** Obtaining credentials for remote access or wireless connections, or spoofing trusted resources for credential harvesting.
* **Supply Chain:** Infiltrating a target via companies in its supply chain, as seen in incidents like the Target data breach.
* **Web and Social Media:** Concealing malware in files attached to posts, using downloads, compromising websites for drive-by downloads, and leveraging social media for social engineering campaigns.
* **Cloud:** Targeting weak credentials for cloud accounts or services, attacking the cloud service provider to gain access to victim systems

Sophisticated threat actors will make use of multiple vectors.
