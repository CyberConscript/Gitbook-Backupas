# Framing

Organisations must define a risk frame to set the groundwork for managing risk and provide limits to risk-based decisions. To create a reasonable risk frame, organizations must identify the following:

* Risk Assumptions: What are the assumptions about threats and vulnerabilities? What is the likelihood of occurrence? What would be the impact and consequences?
* Risk Constraints: What are the constraints on assessing, responding, and monitoring risks?
* Risk Tolerance: What are the acceptable levels of risk? What is the acceptable degree of risk uncertainty?
* Priorities and Trade-offs: What are the high-priority business functions? What are the trade-offs among the different types of faced risks?



## Example Scenario:&#x20;

### Risk Management for a Healthcare Software Company

In this scenario, you are part of the risk management team for a healthcare software company that provides electronic health record (EHR) systems to hospitals and clinics. The company stores sensitive patient data, making it a target for cybercriminals who seek to steal personal health information (PHI).

### **Risk: Data Breach**

#### **Risk Assumptions:**

* The company handles sensitive health data, which is highly valuable to cybercriminals due to the potential for identity theft, insurance fraud, and black-market sales. The assumption is that without proper encryption, access controls, and monitoring, a data breach is highly likely.
* Additionally, the assumption is that adversaries would target the company's cloud infrastructure, where most of the patient data is stored.
* It is also assumed that healthcare clients demand near-constant system availability, so the risk of downtime or delays in implementing security measures needs consideration.

#### **Risk Constraints:**

* **Budgetary Constraints:** Implementing robust security controls, regular audits, and 24/7 monitoring could be expensive. The budget is limited, and management wants to avoid overspending on security at the cost of product development.
* **Regulatory Constraints:** The company must comply with stringent healthcare regulations such as HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) in the U.S. and GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) in Europe. Non-compliance could lead to hefty fines and legal consequences, adding pressure to ensure all safeguards are compliant.
* **Technology Constraints:** Some legacy systems in the company's infrastructure might not support the most up-to-date security protocols, making retrofitting challenging.

#### **Risk Tolerance:**

* **Low Tolerance:** Given the highly sensitive nature of the data, the company cannot tolerate any breach of patient information. A single breach could lead to devastating consequences, including regulatory fines, legal action, and reputational damage.
* **Zero Downtime Tolerance:** Hospitals and clinics depend on the EHR system for real-time data access. A compromise in security should not result in significant downtime or impact the system's availability.

#### **Priorities and Trade-offs:**

* **Priority on Compliance and Security:** The primary priority is ensuring that all data protection measures meet regulatory requirements and that patient data is kept secure from unauthorized access. Failure to prioritize this could lead to legal consequences and loss of clients.
* **Trade-off Between Cost and Security:** The company may need to trade off between security costs and product innovation. While management wants to invest heavily in new features and updates for the EHR system, security investments must take precedence, even if it means delaying certain product upgrades.
* **Balancing Security with User Experience:** Hospitals and clinics need a system that is easy to use and efficient. Some of the proposed security measures, such as multi-factor authentication, might slow down user workflows. The trade-off is between maximizing security while maintaining a streamlined user experience for healthcare providers.

#### Conclusion:

In this scenario, the healthcare software company faces high risks due to the sensitivity of the data it manages. Its assumptions about cyber threats and the constraints posed by budget and compliance define its risk strategy. With low tolerance for breaches and prioritizing regulatory compliance, the company will need to make trade-offs, particularly around balancing security costs with ongoing product development.
