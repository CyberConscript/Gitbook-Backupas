# Risk assessment methodologies

There are several frameworks for risk assessment. Example methodologies are:

* **NIST SP 800-30**: A risk assessment methodology developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). It involves identifying and evaluating risks, determining the likelihood and impact of each risk, and developing a risk response plan.
* **Facilitated Risk Analysis Process (FRAP)**: A risk assessment methodology that involves a group of stakeholders working together to identify and evaluate risks. It is designed to be a more collaborative and inclusive approach to risk analysis.
* **Operationally Critical Threat, Asset, and Vulnerability Evaluation (OCTAVE)**: A risk assessment methodology that focuses on identifying and prioritising assets based on their criticality to the organisationâ€™s mission and assessing the threats and vulnerabilities that could impact those assets.
* **Failure Modes and Effect Analysis (FMEA)**: A risk assessment methodology commonly used in engineering and manufacturing. It involves identifying potential failure modes for a system or process and then analysing the possible effects of those failures and the likelihood of their occurrence.
