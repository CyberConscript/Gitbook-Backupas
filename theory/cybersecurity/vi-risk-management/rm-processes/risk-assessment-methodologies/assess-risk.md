# Assess risk

The goal of the risk assessment is to determine the following:

* **Threats**: What are the threats that you need to consider?
* **Vulnerabilities**: What are the vulnerabilities that you have to deal with?
* **Impact**: What would be the impact if a threat exploited a vulnerability?
* **Likelihood**: What is the likelihood of this vulnerability being exploited?



#### **Risk of Social Engineering Attack on a Nonprofit Organization**

A nonprofit organization working on humanitarian projects stores sensitive donor information on its network. While it doesn't handle valuable trade secrets or high-profile financial transactions, it is still vulnerable to a social engineering attack, such as phishing, aimed at stealing login credentials or tricking employees into transferring funds. Given the organizationâ€™s reliance on public goodwill, such an attack could seriously damage its reputation and donor trust.

* **Threat:** Social Engineering (Phishing)
* **Vulnerability:** Employees may lack training to detect phishing attempts
* **Impact:** Financial loss and damage to reputation
* **Likelihood:** High, as nonprofits are often targeted due to their reliance on less sophisticated security measures and public exposure
