## **Third-Party Risks and Vendor Management**

Supply chain management in cybersecurity involves ensuring the security and integrity of products and services throughout the supply chain, from the initial sourcing of components to the delivery of the final product to the end-user.  \
The recognition of supply chain significance in vulnerability management has grown due to high-profile breaches. Products or services often comprise components developed by various companies. The chain's integrity hinges on suppliers evaluating their vendors' diligence. A weak link can result in service disruption, performance issues, or data breaches.

## **Vendor Management Explained**

Vendor management involves selecting suppliers and assessing risks tied to third-party products/services. Risks cannot be fully shifted to vendors in data and cybersecurity. If a vendor encounters a data breach, costs can be claimed, but legal penalties and reputation damage remain the contracting company's responsibility. For instance, webstore outages due to hosting provider failures affect the company's reputation and orders.

Vendors may present certifications and documentation demonstrating robust security policies. Evidence of security capabilities like effective vulnerability management and product support can be observed. Larger firms often subject vendors to in-depth audits to ensure compliance with standards.

## **System Integration and Risks**

System integration in vendor management means using components/services from various vendors for a business workflow. However, the contracting company might lack expertise, overly trusting third-party integrators. Vendor dependency within workflows necessitates contingency plans in case vendor support wanes.

## **Outsourced Code Development and Data Storage**

Outsourced code development presents oversight challenges. Without in-house programming knowledge, ensuring secure code from contractors becomes difficult. Employing separate vendors for development and vulnerability/penetration testing is a remedy.

Data risks with third parties involve granting access and hosting. Precautions include applying on-premises data protections, monitoring third-party data access, and assessing compliance implications for personal data storage.

## **Cloud-Based vs. On-Premises Risks**

Cloud and on-premises environments share vendor management, code, and data storage risks. However, software and configuration vulnerabilities also apply to both. Cloud services adhere to a shared responsibility model, where the cloud provider secures the cloud, and the consumer secures within the cloud. Software and configuration vulnerabilities vary depending on the service type.
