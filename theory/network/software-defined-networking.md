# Software defined networking

Software-Defined Networking (SDN) is an approach to network management that enables programmability, automation, and centralized control of the network infrastructure through software applications. SDN decouples the control plane from the data plane, allowing network administrators to dynamically manage and control network resources based on the needs of applications and workloads. This shift from traditional, hardware-centric network architectures brings several benefits, including increased flexibility, scalability, and efficiency. Here are key components and concepts of Software-Defined Networking:

#### Components of SDN:

1. **Controller:**
   * **Description:** The SDN controller is the central brain of the SDN architecture. It acts as a management plane that communicates with switches and routers in the network, providing a centralized view and control over network policies.
   * **Functions:**
     * Orchestrates network resources.
     * Enforces policies and configurations.
     * Communicates with SDN-enabled devices.
2. **Southbound APIs:**
   * **Description:** Southbound APIs facilitate communication between the SDN controller and network devices, allowing the controller to instruct switches and routers on how to handle traffic.
   * **Protocols:**
     * OpenFlow is a commonly used southbound API protocol.
     * Other protocols, such as NETCONF or gRPC, may also be used.
3. **Northbound APIs:**
   * **Description:** Northbound APIs enable communication between the SDN controller and applications or business logic. These APIs allow external applications to request services or provide instructions to the SDN controller.
   * **Use Cases:**
     * Integration with network management applications.
     * Interaction with cloud orchestration systems.
4. **Data Plane:**
   * **Description:** The data plane (forwarding plane) is responsible for handling the actual transmission of data packets within the network. In SDN, the data plane operates independently of the control plane and is responsible for packet forwarding based on the instructions received from the SDN controller.
   * **Functions:**
     * Forwards packets based on flow tables and rules.
     * Implements policies defined by the controller.

#### SDN Concepts and Principles:

1. **Flow Table:**
   * **Description:** In SDN-enabled devices, flow tables store information about how to handle specific flows of network traffic. The SDN controller populates these flow tables with rules and policies.
   * **Contents:**
     * Match fields (criteria for identifying packets).
     * Actions (instructions on how to process matching packets).
2. **Flow:**
   * **Description:** A flow represents a sequence of packets that share common characteristics. Flows are identified based on specific criteria, such as source and destination addresses, ports, or protocols.
   * **Handling:**
     * The SDN controller defines how flows are processed and forwarded by configuring flow tables.
3. **OpenFlow Protocol:**
   * **Description:** OpenFlow is a standard communication protocol between the SDN controller and network devices (switches and routers). It enables the controller to instruct devices on how to handle network traffic.
   * **Functions:**
     * Specifies actions for packet forwarding.
     * Allows the controller to modify flow tables.
4. **Network Virtualization:**
   * **Description:** SDN allows for the creation of virtual networks that operate independently within the same physical infrastructure. Network virtualization enables the segmentation and isolation of network resources for different applications or tenants.
   * **Benefits:**
     * Improved resource utilization.
     * Enhanced isolation and security.
5. **Centralized Control:**
   * **Description:** SDN centralizes control over the network, allowing administrators to manage and configure network policies from a single pointâ€”the SDN controller. This simplifies network management and reduces the need for device-specific configurations.
   * **Advantages:**
     * Efficient policy enforcement.
     * Simplified network administration.
6. **Programmability:**
   * **Description:** SDN offers programmable interfaces that allow administrators to define and modify network behavior through software. This programmability enables automation and customization of network configurations.
   * **Use Cases:**
     * Dynamic adjustment of network policies.
     * Integration with orchestration systems.
7. **Dynamic Orchestration:**
   * **Description:** SDN enables dynamic orchestration of network resources based on changing requirements. This includes the ability to scale resources, reroute traffic, and adapt to evolving workloads.
   * **Benefits:**
     * On-demand resource allocation.
     * Improved responsiveness to changing conditions.

#### Benefits of SDN:

1. **Flexibility and Agility:**
   * SDN provides a flexible and agile network infrastructure that can adapt to changing business needs, applications, and workloads.
2. **Centralized Management:**
   * The centralized control plane simplifies network management and allows administrators to define policies and configurations from a single point.
3. **Programmability and Automation:**
   * SDN's programmable interfaces enable automation, allowing administrators to automate routine tasks and respond quickly to network changes.
4. **Efficient Resource Utilization:**
   * With the ability to dynamically allocate and reallocate resources, SDN improves the overall efficiency of network resource utilization.
5. **Improved Visibility and Monitoring:**
   * SDN provides enhanced visibility into network traffic and activities, making it easier to monitor and analyze network behavior.
6. **Network Virtualization and Segmentation:**
   * SDN supports network virtualization, allowing for the creation of isolated virtual networks within a shared physical infrastructure. This enhances security and isolation.
7. **Reduced Capital and Operational Costs:**
   * The centralized management and programmability of SDN contribute to lower capital and operational costs by stream
