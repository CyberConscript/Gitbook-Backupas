# Packet Injection and Replay

Certain reconnaissance techniques and tests rely on the transmission of counterfeit or spoofed network data. Frequently, network sniffing software libraries enable the insertion (or injection) of frames into the network flow. Additionally, there are tools that facilitate the creation and manipulation of diverse packet types. Prominent tools used for packet injection encompass Ettercap (ettercap-project.org), Scapy (scapy.net), and hping (linux.die.net/man/8/hping3). hping

**hping**, an open-source spoofing tool, equips penetration testers with the capability to construct network packets for exploiting vulnerable firewalls and IDSs. hping can undertake the following types of examinations:

Host/port detection and firewall testing—akin to Nmap, hping probes IP addresses and TCP/UDP ports to elicit responses. Traceroute—when ICMP is blocked within a local network, hping provides alternate means of delineating network routes. By employing arbitrary packet formats, like investigating DNS ports through TCP or UDP, hping conducts tracing. Denial of service (DoS)—hping is effective for launching flood-based DoS attacks from randomized source IPs. This technique proves valuable within a testing environment to gauge the effectiveness of a firewall, IDS, or load balancer against such assaults.

**tcpreplay**

As its name implies, tcpreplay takes previously captured traffic stored in a .pcap file and replays it via a network interface (linux.die.net/man/1/tcpreplay). Optionally, certain fields within the capture can be modified, such as substituting MAC or IP addresses. tcpreplay serves an analytical purpose. When you possess captured suspicious traffic, replaying it via a monitored network interface allows you to test intrusion detection rules.
