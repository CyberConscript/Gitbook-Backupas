## Intro

Packet analysis tools, also known as network protocol analyzers or packet sniffers, are used to capture and analyze network traffic at the packet level. These tools provide insights into network performance, security issues, and troubleshooting network-related problems. Here are some fundamental concepts and features of packet analysis tools:

1. **Packet Capture**: Packet analysis tools capture network packets flowing through a network interface or a specific network segment. They capture packets in real-time or from stored packet capture files (PCAP).
2. **Protocol Decoding**: Packet analyzers dissect captured packets and decode the various network protocols in use. They interpret the protocol headers and provide detailed information about the packet, such as source and destination IP addresses, port numbers, packet types, and payload data.
3. **Filtering**: Packet analyzers allow you to filter captured packets based on specific criteria, such as source/destination IP address, port number, protocol type, or packet content. Filtering helps focus on relevant packets for analysis and reduces the volume of captured data.
4. **Packet Analysis and Inspection**: Once packets are captured and decoded, packet analysis tools provide features to inspect and analyze packet-level details. This includes examining packet timing, sequence analysis, error detection, packet reassembly, and extraction of metadata or content from packets.
5. **Performance Analysis**: Packet analyzers can help analyze network performance by measuring network latency, packet loss, throughput, and response times. They provide statistics, charts, and graphs to visualize network performance metrics.
6. **Security Analysis**: Packet analysis tools are often used for network security analysis. They can detect and analyze suspicious or malicious network traffic, identify anomalies, monitor for known attack signatures, and aid in forensic investigations.
7. **Protocol Troubleshooting**: Packet analyzers assist in troubleshooting network issues by providing visibility into packet-level details. They help identify misconfigurations, network congestion, latency problems, protocol errors, or issues related to specific applications or services.
8. **Reporting and Exporting**: Packet analysis tools typically offer reporting capabilities to summarize analysis results and generate detailed reports. They may also support exporting captured packets or analysis results in various formats for further analysis or sharing with other team members.

It's important to note that proficiency in using packet analysis tools requires knowledge of networking protocols, packet structures, and an understanding of network behavior.



## Tapping into the wire

There are several ways to tap into a network wire to capture network traffic. Here are some common methods:

1.  **Port Mirroring/Spanning:** Port mirroring, also known as port spanning or port monitoring, involves configuring a network switch to copy network traffic from one or more ports and send it to another designated monitoring port. This allows a network analyzer or packet capture tool to capture and analyze the mirrored traffic:

    * Leaves no network footprint and generates no additional packets&#x20;
    * Can be configured without taking the client offline, which is convenient when mirroring router or server ports
    * Requires processing resources from the switch and can be inconsistent at higher throughput levels&#x20;
    * Works when you are not concerned about taking the host temporarily offline&#x20;
    * Ineffective when you must capture traffic from multiple hosts, as collisions and dropped packets are likely&#x20;
    * Can result in lost packets on modern 100/1000Mbps hosts because most true hubs are only 10Mbps


2. **Network TAP:** A network TAP (Terminal Access Point) is a hardware device that provides a passive way to access network traffic. It is typically inserted between network devices or network cables, allowing a third-party device to monitor and capture the traffic passing through. Network TAPs provide full visibility into network traffic without introducing additional latency or disturbing network operations. &#x20;
   * Ideal when you are not concerned about taking the host temporarily offline&#x20;
   * The only option when you need to sniff traffic from a fiber-optic connection&#x20;
   * Preferred solution for enterprise packet capture and continuous monitoring because taps are reliable and can scale to high throughput links&#x20;
   * Since taps are made for the task at hand and are up to par with modern network speeds, this method is superior to hubbing out .
   * Can be expensive, especially at scale, and so may be cost prohibitive
3. **ARP Cache Poisoning**: ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) cache poisoning, also known as ARP spoofing, involves manipulating the ARP tables on devices in a network. By sending fake ARP messages, an attacker can associate their MAC address with the IP address of another network device. This allows the attacker to intercept and capture network traffic intended for that device.
4. **Hub-based Monitoring**: Hubs are legacy networking devices that broadcast incoming network packets to all connected devices. By connecting a monitoring device to a hub, all network traffic can be captured and analyzed. However, hubs have largely been replaced by switches in modern network infrastructures.
5. **Inline Network Appliances**: Inline network appliances, such as Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) or Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS), are deployed in the network path to actively monitor and analyze network traffic. These appliances inspect packets in real-time, detecting and potentially preventing security threats or policy violations.
6. **Virtual Switch Port Mirroring**: In virtualized environments, virtual switches provide the capability to mirror network traffic similar to physical switches. Virtual port mirroring copies virtual machine network traffic and sends it to a designated virtual switch port, allowing virtualized network monitoring and analysis.
7. **Software-based Packet Capture**: Software-based packet capture tools, also known as packet sniffers, run on a computer or server connected to the network. They capture and analyze network traffic by placing the network interface into promiscuous mode, enabling the capture of all packets traversing the network interface.

Each of these methods has its advantages and considerations in terms of network visibility, deployment complexity, and potential impact on network performance. The choice of tapping method depends on the specific network environment, requirements, and the purpose of network monitoring or analysis. Chart to decide:

## Wireless

When it comes to a wireless card; there are four types of modes that we can refer to, and they are as follows:

1. Ad-hoc – In this mode, the nodes are connected directly to each other, and there is no Access Point or Base Station.
2. Managed mode – In this mode, every node is a connection to the Access Point or Base Station. This is the mode that most users are in because it is the mode when you are connected.
3. Master mode – In this mode, a node acts as an Access Point, and other nodes can connect to it.
4. Monitor mode – In this mode, the nodes are not connected to the network, and this is the equivalent of our promiscuous mode from our wired network discussion.



With our wireless network cards, the main thing is the chipset; we want to ensure our chipset provides us with our required capabilities. There are multiple chips that will support all of the required features for wireless hacking and penetration testing: [https://www.kalilinux.in/2022/04/wifi-adapter-for-kali-linux.html](https://www.kalilinux.in/2022/04/wifi-adapter-for-kali-linux.html)
