# Contract management

Proper legal advice should always be sought before you agree to sign, or produce such a document.

A brief word on storage: typically the CFO keeps all paper (or hard) copies of the\
contracts, all signed and sealed. However, it is a good idea for you to keep a digital version of them in your usual file space (Google Drive, Dropbox, Office 365) for fast\
retrieval and reference.



## Service agreements

A successful engagement is one where both parties are clear on the responsibilities of each and the cost associated with rendering the service. A service agreement should lay out clearly what your expectations are.

Content:

* Commencement date&#x20;
* Prerequisites
* Costs
* Ownership
* Deliverables
* Responsibilities
* Reports
* Availability
* How things will be handled over
* How to terminate&#x20;



## Statement of work

Looking at a typical statement of work, you may have the following areas:\
 Scope of work: areas that will be worked on, areas that won’t be\
 Definition of deliverables: source code, library, or service\
 When the assignment of the IPR of the rendered work occurs\
 Access required to fulfill the contract\
 Flexibility/restrictions on personnel, or subcontracting the work\
 Authorization steps for any out-of-scope work, additional licenses, or travel\
 Warranty on any rendered work\
 Time frame of contract\
 Extension/renewal/termination procedures\
 Limitations on solutions offered\
 Payment terms



## NDA

A nondisclosure agreement (NDA) is a mini contract that exists\
between two parties for them to be able to exchange information confidentially to advance discussions without fear of loss or misuse of IPR (intellectual\
property rights). It is usually limited in scope and has an associated time span.\
Having an NDA established and validated by your company's lawyer is good\
for your arsenal so you have it when needed. Typically signed by your CFO or\
CEO, this document safeguards your trade secrets and processes, while letting\
you have limited conversations to advance your short-term goal.
