# Contract management

Proper legal advice should always be sought before you agree to sign, or produce such a document.

A brief word on storage: typically the CFO keeps all paper (or hard) copies of the\
contracts, all signed and sealed. However, it is a good idea for you to keep a digital version of them in your usual file space (Google Drive, Dropbox, Office 365) for fast\
retrieval and reference.



## Service agreements

A successful engagement is one where both parties are clear on the responsibilities of each and the cost associated with rendering the service. A service agreement should lay out clearly what your expectations are.

Content:

* Commencement date&#x20;
* Prerequisites
* Costs
* Ownership
* Deliverables
* Responsibilities
* Reports
* Availability
* How things will be handled over
* How to terminate&#x20;



## Statement of work

Looking at a typical statement of work, you may have the following areas:\
 Scope of work: areas that will be worked on, areas that won’t be\
 Definition of deliverables: source code, library, or service\
 When the assignment of the IPR of the rendered work occurs\
 Access required to fulfill the contract\
 Flexibility/restrictions on personnel, or subcontracting the work\
 Authorization steps for any out-of-scope work, additional licenses, or travel\
 Warranty on any rendered work\
 Time frame of contract\
 Extension/renewal/termination procedures\
 Limitations on solutions offered\
 Payment terms



## NDA

A nondisclosure agreement (NDA) is a mini contract that exists\
between two parties for them to be able to exchange information confidentially to advance discussions without fear of loss or misuse of IPR (intellectual\
property rights). It is usually limited in scope and has an associated time span.\
Having an NDA established and validated by your company's lawyer is good\
for your arsenal so you have it when needed. Typically signed by your CFO or\
CEO, this document safeguards your trade secrets and processes, while letting\
you have limited conversations to advance your short-term goal.



## SLA

The service-level agreement, or SLA, is commonly used to define the minimum or maximum limits of a service or product. For example, if you run a service, what is your\
expected uptime, and if you fail to deliver that, what is the recourse for the user?

The purpose of an SLA is to provide the confidence and faith that you can rely on\
a given service. Say, for example, Amazon didn’t have an SLA, or, even worse, it had an\
uptime of only 50%. That means they could be down for up to two weeks in every\
month, with no recourse for the customer. Could your business tolerate such poor\
availability of service?\
An SLA agreement is very common for cloud and X-as-a-Service types. For anything where you are relying on a third party to power some or all of your business, an\
SLA will allow you to determine how much uptime, at the very least, you can expect,\
which in turn informs your customers what their expectation can be of your service.\
SLAs can come in different levels, with the more 9s (.999999) of reliability you\
need from a service, the more expensive it will be. Finding that balance will depend\
largely on your need and may not be the same for all. Some parts of your ecosystem\
will be able to tolerate more downtime than others.\
An SLA can also define how long to expect between when a bug or issue is\
reported to when a successful resolution would be delivered. The more important a\
service is, the more you will want to demand from the SLA.

The first thing to note is that an SLA with 100% availability is unattainable—too many\
variables are in play to make this truly achievable. So, as you come up with your uptime\
assurances, here are the things you need to factor in before delivering your number:\
 Of all the third-part services you rely on, what has the worst SLA in that list?\
(You are only as strong as your weakest link.)\
 How much downtime do you need to do releases or system upgrades?\
 Are you able to offer an SLA for a full 24 hours each day or only during core\
business hours?\
 What is the time for resolution on a given reported issue?\
 Do you have the necessary support staff in place to cover support, especially\
during vacations?\
 What has been the track record of your offering thus far?

What is the weakest part, or single point of failure, in your offering that would\
affect up

## Evaluating vendors

Alignment of skills—Determine\
whether the skills of the vendor\
will align with your needs. You\
don’t want the vendor you are\
outsourcing to to be learning on the contract. Their skills must compliment\
your needs from the moment they start the engagement. This may involve you\
interviewing the resources that will be working directly on your project for you\
to gain confidence.\
 Depth of knowledge—Cursory knowledge of a subject isn’t going to work for you.\
The purpose of engaging a vendor in the first place is because your team lacks\
the expertise. Testing the company with some exercises will give you the confidence they can handle any problem you throw at them.\
 Accessibility—As you think of your requirements, will you need out-of-hours coverage (common for support contracts)? There may be specific times of the year\
you need the vendor to be more attentive than others. You should rate how they\
handle requests (both during and outside of regular hours), their response\
time, communication style, updates, and messaging.\
 Scalability—As you grow, will they be able to grow and adapt to your needs? Be\
cautious if there is only one expert in the company. What happens if they go on\
vacation or, worse, leave? You are relying on them to share their knowledge with\
their team so you have continuity of service.\
 References/affiliations—Ask for references from clients who have requirements\
similar to yours. If they are providing support for a given product, does that product have recommended service vendors or partner programs, and are they\
part of that?



## Software licensing

Many software applications can help you keep on top of your licenses. If your organization isn’t of the size to really benefit from such an extra expenditure, keep it simple to begin with and track all software licenses in a shareable spreadsheet. Capture\
the following details at a minimum:\
 Date of acquisition\
 Renewal date/cost\
 Contact details\
 Contact details they have for you, such as email/phone/address\
 Notes on internal usage\
 License keys/codes



This list should be reviewed at least every six months to make sure it’s kept up to date\
as well as anytime a new purchase is made or renewal is done.
