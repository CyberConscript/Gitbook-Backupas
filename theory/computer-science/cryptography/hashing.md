# Hashing

A **hash value** is a fixed-size string or characters that is computed by a hash function. A **hash function** takes an input of an arbitrary size and returns an output of fixed length, i.e., a hash value. We will cover various exciting and clever uses of hash functions and values in this room.

A hash function takes some input data of any size and creates a summary or **digest** of that data. The output has a fixed size. It’s hard to predict the output for any input and vice versa. Good hashing algorithms will be relatively fast to compute and prohibitively slow to reverse, i.e., go from the output and determine the input. Any slight change in the input data, even a single bit, should cause a significant change in the output.

When you log into your computer, hashing plays a role in verifying your password.

The **pigeonhole effect** states that the number of items (_pigeons_) is more than the number of containers (_pigeonholes_); some containers must hold more than one item. In other words, in this context, there are a fixed number of different output values for the hash function, but you can give it any size input. As there are more inputs than outputs, some inputs must inevitably give the same output. If you have 21 pigeons and 16 pigeonholes, some of the pigeons are going to share the pigeonholes. Consequently, collisions are unavoidable. However, a good hash function ensures that the probability of a collision is negligible.

`md5sum`, `sha1sum`, `sha256sum`, and `sha512sum` produce their outputs in hexadecimal format.

## Linux Passwords

On Linux, password hashes are stored in `/etc/shadow`, which is normally only readable by root. They used to be stored in `/etc/passwd`, which was readable by everyone.

The `/etc/shadow` file is the file on Linux machines where password hashes are stored. It also stores other information, such as the date of last password change and password expiration information. It contains one entry per line for each user or user account of the system. This file is usually only accessible by the root user, so you must have sufficient privileges to access the hashes. However, if you do, there is a chance that you will be able to crack some of the hashes.



The `shadow` file contains the password information. Each line contains nine fields, separated by colons (`:`). The first two fields are the login name and the encrypted password. More information about the other fields can be found by executing `man 5 shadow` on a Linux system.

```

The fields are separated by colons. The important ones are the username and the hash algorithm, salt, and hash value. The second field has the format `$prefix$options$salt$hash`.

In the example above, we have four parts separated by `$`:

* `y` indicates the hash algorithm used, **yescrypt**
* `j9T` is a parameter passed to the algorithm
* `76UzfgEM5PnymhQ7TlJey1` is the salt used
* `/OOSg64dhfF.TigVPdzqiFang6uZA4QA1pzzegKdVm4` is the hash value''

### Unshadowing

John can be very particular about the formats it needs data in to be able to work with it; for this reason, to crack `/etc/shadow` passwords, you must combine it with the `/etc/passwd` file for John to understand the data it’s being given. To do this, we use a tool built into the John suite of tools called `unshadow`. The basic syntax of `unshadow` is as follows:

`unshadow [path to passwd] [path to shadow]`

* `unshadow`: Invokes the unshadow tool
* `[path to passwd]`: The file that contains the copy of the `/etc/passwd` file you’ve taken from the target machine
* `[path to shadow]`: The file that contains the copy of the `/etc/shadow` file you’ve taken from the target machine

`unshadow local_passwd local_shadow > unshadowed.txt`

## MS Windows Passwords

MS Windows passwords are hashed using NTLM, a variant of MD4. They’re visually identical to MD4 and MD5 hashes, so it’s very important to use context to determine the hash type.

On MS Windows, password hashes are stored in the SAM (Security Accounts Manager). MS Windows tries to prevent normal users from dumping them, but tools like mimikatz exist to circumvent MS Windows security. Notably, the hashes found there are split into NT hashes and LM hashes.



A bit of history: the NT designation for Windows products originally meant New Technology. It was used starting with Windows NT to denote products not built from the MS-DOS Operating System. Eventually, the “NT” line became the standard Operating System type to be released by Microsoft, and the name was dropped, but it still lives on in the names of some Microsoft technologies.

In Windows, SAM (Security Account Manager) is used to store user account information, including usernames and hashed passwords. You can acquire NTHash/NTLM hashes by dumping the SAM database on a Windows machine, using a tool like Mimikatz, or using the Active Directory database: `NTDS.dit`. You may not have to crack the hash to continue privilege escalation, as you can often conduct a “pass the hash” attack instead, but sometimes, hash cracking is a viable option if there is a weak password policy.

A great place to find more hash formats and password prefixes is the [Hashcat Example Hashes](https://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=example_hashes) page. For other hash types, you’ll typically need to check the length or encoding or even conduct some research into the application that generated them. Never underestimate the power of research.

## John the ripper

**Installing on Windows**

To install Jumbo John the Ripper on Windows, you need to download and install the zipped binary for either 64-bit systems [here](https://www.openwall.com/john/k/john-1.9.0-jumbo-1-win64.zip) or for 32-bit systems [here](https://www.openwall.com/john/k/john-1.9.0-jumbo-1-win32.zip).

As we mentioned earlier, to use a dictionary attack against hashes, you need a list of words to hash and compare; unsurprisingly, this is called a wordlist. There are many different wordlists out there, and a good collection can be found in the [SecLists](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists) repository.



### John Basic Syntax

The basic syntax of John the Ripper commands is as follows. We will cover the specific options and modifiers used as we use them.

`john [options] [file path]`

* `john`: Invokes the John the Ripper program
* `[options]`: Specifies the options you want to use
* `[file path]`: The file containing the hash you’re trying to crack; if it’s in the same directory, you won’t need to name a path, just the file.



John has built-in features to detect what type of hash it’s being given and to select appropriate rules and formats to crack it for you; this isn’t always the best idea as it can be unreliable, but if you can’t identify what hash type you’re working with and want to try cracking it, it can be a good option! To do this, we use the following syntax:

`john --wordlist=[path to wordlist] [path to file]`

* `--wordlist=`: Specifies using wordlist mode, reading from the file that you supply in the provided path
* `[path to wordlist]`: The path to the wordlist you’re using, as described in the previous task

**Example Usage:**

`john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt hash_to_crack.txt`



Sometimes, John won’t play nicely with automatically recognizing and loading hashes, but that’s okay! We can use other tools to identify the hash and then set John to a specific format. There are multiple ways to do this, such as using an online hash identifier like [this site](https://hashes.com/en/tools/hash_identifier). I like to use a tool called [hash-identifier](https://gitlab.com/kalilinux/packages/hash-identifier/-/tree/kali/master), a Python tool that is super easy to use and will tell you what different types of hashes the one you enter is likely to be, giving you more options if the first one fails.

To use hash-identifier, you can use `wget` or `curl` to download the Python file `hash-id.py` from its GitLab [page](https://gitlab.com/kalilinux/packages/hash-identifier/-/raw/kali/master/hash-id.py). Then, launch it with `python3 hash-id.py` and enter the hash you’re trying to identify. It will give you a list of the most probable formats. These two steps are shown in the terminal below.

### Using Single Crack Mode

To use single crack mode, we use roughly the same syntax that we’ve used so far; for example, if we wanted to crack the password of the user named “Mike”, using the single mode, we’d use:

`john --single --format=[format] [path to file]`

`john --single --format=raw-sha256 hashes.txt`

### Format-Specific Cracking

Once you have identified the hash that you’re dealing with, you can tell John to use it while cracking the provided hash using the following syntax:

`john --format=[format] --wordlist=[path to wordlist] [path to file]`

* `--format=`: This is the flag to tell John that you’re giving it a hash of a specific format and to use the following format to crack it
* `[format]`: The format that the hash is in

**Example Usage:**

`john --format=raw-md5 --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt hash_to_crack.txt`



john --format=whirlpool --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt hash4.txt

**A Note on Formats:**

When you tell John to use formats, if you’re dealing with a standard hash type, e.g. md5 as in the example above, you have to prefix it with `raw-` to tell John you’re just dealing with a standard hash type, though this doesn’t always apply. To check if you need to add the prefix or not, you can list all of John’s formats using `john --list=formats` and either check manually or grep for your hash type using something like `john --list=formats | grep -iF "md5"`.



### Common Custom Rules

Many organisations will require a certain level of password complexity to try and combat dictionary attacks. In other words, when creating a new account or changing your password, if you attempt a password like `polopassword`, it will most likely not work. The reason would be the enforced password complexity. As a result, you may receive a prompt telling you that passwords have to contain at least one character from each of the following:

* Lowercase letter
* Uppercase letter
* Number
* Symbol



### How to create Custom Rules

Custom rules are defined in the `john.conf` file. This file can be found in `/opt/john/john.conf` on the TryHackMe Attackbox. It is usually located in `/etc/john/john.conf` if you have installed John using a package manager or built from source with `make`.





### Zip2John

Similarly to the `unshadow` tool we used previously, we will use the `zip2john` tool to convert the Zip file into a hash format that John can understand and hopefully crack. The primary usage is like this:

`zip2john [options] [zip file] > [output file]`

* `[options]`: Allows you to pass specific checksum options to `zip2john`; this shouldn’t often be necessary
* `[zip file]`: The path to the Zip file you wish to get the hash of
* `>`: This redirects the output from this command to another file
* `[output file]`: This is the file that will store the output

**Example Usage**

`zip2john zipfile.zip > zip_hash.txt`

#### Cracking

We’re then able to take the file we output from `zip2john` in our example use case, `zip_hash.txt`, and, as we did with `unshadow`, feed it directly into John as we have made the input specifically for it.

`john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt zip_hash.txt`



### Rar2John

Almost identical to the `zip2john` tool, we will use the `rar2john` tool to convert the RAR file into a hash format that John can understand. The basic syntax is as follows:

`rar2john [rar file] > [output file]`

* `rar2john`: Invokes the `rar2john` tool
* `[rar file]`: The path to the RAR file you wish to get the hash of
* `>`: This redirects the output of this command to another file
* `[output file]`: This is the file that will store the output from the command<br>

**Example Usage**

`/opt/john/rar2john rarfile.rar > rar_hash.txt`

#### Cracking

Once again, we can take the file we output from `rar2john` in our example use case, `rar_hash.txt`, and feed it directly into John as we did with `zip2john`.

`john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt rar_hash.txt`
