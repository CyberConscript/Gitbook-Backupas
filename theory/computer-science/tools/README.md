## Network vulnerability scanner

A network vulnerability scanner, like Tenable Nessus or OpenVAS, is specifically developed to evaluate various network hosts, encompassing client computers, mobile devices, servers, routers, and switches. It thoroughly inspects the components within an organization's local environment, including systems, applications, and devices, and subsequently cross-references the findings from the scan against established configuration templates and comprehensive lists of recognized vulnerabilities. The outcomes of a vulnerability assessment usually encompass pinpointing absent software patches, deviations from standard configuration templates, and other vulnerabilities that are interconnected.

## Dedicated scanner

An application scanner designed for a specific purpose employs intricate and specialized scripts to meticulously examine known attack vectors. Additionally, it scans for inadequately applied patches and feeble configurations. Among the prominent members of this category are web application scanners, with tools like Nikto being exemplary. These tools actively seek out recognized web-based vulnerabilities like SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS), and can delve into source code and database security to unveil insecure programming techniques. Diverse types of application scanners may be optimized to cater to distinct software categories, such as those tailored for database servers.
