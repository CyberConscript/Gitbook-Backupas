### Applications of C Programming <a href="#applications_of_c_programming" id="applications_of_c_programming"></a>

C was initially used for system development work, particularly the programs that make-up the operating system. C was adopted as a system development language because it produces code that runs nearly as fast as the code written in assembly language. Some examples of the use of C are -

* Operating Systems
* Language Compilers
* Assemblers
* Text Editors
* Print Spoolers
* Network Drivers
* Modern Programs
* Databases
* Language Interpreters
* Utilities



### C is a Procedural and Structured Language

C is described as procedure-oriented and structured programming language. It is procedural because a C program is a series of instructions that explain the procedure of solving a given problem. It makes the development process easier.



### C is a General-Purpose Language

The C language hasn't been developed with a specific area of application as a target. From system programming to photo editing software, the C programming language is used in various applications.

Some of the common applications of C programming include the development of [Operating Systems](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating\_system/index.htm), databases, device drivers, etc.



### C is a Fast Programming Language

C is a compiler-based language which makes the compilation and execution of codes faster. The source code is translated into a hardware-specific machine code, which is easier for the [CPU](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/computer\_fundamentals/computer\_cpu.htm) to execute, without any virtual machine, as some of the other languages like [Java](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/java/index.htm) need.

The fact that C is a statically typed language also makes it faster compared to dynamically typed languages. Being a compiler-based language, it is faster as compared to interpreter-based languages.

### C is Portable

Another feature of the C language is its portability. C programs are machine-independent which means that you can compile and run the same code on various machines with none or some machine-specific changes.

C programming provides the functionality of using a single code on multiple systems depending on the requirement.

### C is Extensible

C is an extensible language. It means if a code is already written, you can add new features to it with a few alterations. Basically, it allows adding new features, functionalities, and operations to an existing C program.

### Standard Libraries in C

Most of the C compilers are bundled with an extensive set of [libraries](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/c\_standard\_library/index.htm) with several built-in functions. It includes OS-specific utilities, string manipulation, mathematical functions, etc.

Importantly, you can also create your user-defined functions and add them to the existing C libraries. The availability of such a vast scope of functions and operations allows a programmer to build a vast array of programs and applications using the C language.

### Pointers in C

One of the unique features of C is its ability to manipulate the internal memory of the computer. With the use of pointers in C, you can directly interact with the memory.

[Pointers](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cprogramming/c\_pointers.htm) point to a specific location in the memory and interact directly with it. Using the C pointers, you can interact with external hardware devices, interrupts, etc.
