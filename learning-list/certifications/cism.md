Direct Work Experience\
You must have a minimum of five years of work experience in the field of information\
security management. This is equivalent to roughly 10,000 actual work hours, which\
must be related to three or more of the CISM job practice areas, as follows:\
• Information security governance Establish and/or maintain an information\
security governance framework and supporting processes to ensure that the\
information security strategy is aligned with organizational goals and objectives.\
• Information security risk management Manage information risk to an\
acceptable level based on risk appetite to meet organizational goals and objectives.\
• Information security program Develop and maintain an information security\
program that identifies, manages, and protects the organization’s assets while\
aligning to information security strategy and business goals, thereby supporting\
an effective security posture.\
• Incident management Plan, establish, and manage the capability to detect,\
investigate, respond to, and recover from information security and disaster\
incidents to minimize business impact.\
All work experience must be completed within the ten-year period before completing the certification application or within five years from the date of initially passing the\
CISM exam. You will need to complete a separate Verification of Work Experience form\
for each segment of experience.
